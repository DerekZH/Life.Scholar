contact detail for your feedback or more help \\t insight show that is an object in number even top level scope is run within an object other insight that we will cover are of of it is import that you of key to learn is to make sure that you retain inform and the best way to high is to do you will be remind about the key point from the 2 video and also get some more that i did not cover i will do by an code so you need to the code and make your own step is also key for deep learn you will learn that class in are object is the key insight that you need to understand about the class the whole is of of class will learn that your class name are just constant and your class are just an of class from standard key to learn is to make sure that you retain inform and the best way to high is to do you will be remind about the key point from the are video and also get some more that i did not cover i will do by some code so take your time and the code and make your own about it step is key for deep learn insight talk about scope you will learn when how and to what scope are in your code you will be given a rule that explain all scope the rule and you will know the of current key to learn is to make sure that you retain inform and the best way to high is to do you will be remind about the key point from the video and also get some more that i did not cover in the video i will do by some code so take your time and the code and make your own about it step is key for deep learn insight show that class and in are the same with the differ be that you can and build inherit with class but not key to learn is to make sure that you retain inform and the best way to high is to do you will be remind about the key point from the are with video and also get some more that i did not cover in the video i will do by some code so take your time and the code and make your own about it step is key for deep learn video you will learn all about inherit in how inherit is built and how fit into the what order etc ) key to learn is to make sure that you retain inform and the best way to high is to do you will be remind about the key point from the video and also get some more that i did not cover in the video i will do by some code so take your time and the code and make your own about it step is key for deep learn other program class don\\'t have class they just spring into exist when they are assign a in video you will to understand and where and method it will help you better understand your code can or cannot access an or a method also it will be of great help to understand method rule for and method live \" video insight show and explain which exact method will call when you send a to an object you will be given a list of 4 and to direct that use to find a method which exact method will be is the key to do you will need to know where you should add a method to your goal so make sure you pay special \\t quick for video in we will the insight from and drastic the method rule insight is all about and scope in you will learn all about the follow \\t you will also learn about each when a is and when is it you will put learn so far into a grand that is known as object to make more visual with code that start with a code and increment build into more complex that show differ aspect of object model also will be visual to help you grasp the idea and concept more i will point out some aspect of block in that you need to know to use their full in your along the way you will one of the common trick use in on rail and understand it work video you will learn about method from standard that get inform about your object for object class name public protect singleton method etc also about avail their and how to their video you will learn one of your first trick you will learn how to custom keyword like or method video we will to go through method from standard that are use in learn about the method that help us get inform about class method and so it is about time to learn how to them video you will learn how you can your own method that just like method also you will learn that can be use to method from rail such etc from class will the magic behind these method learn about and get inform about class method and all kind of now it time to learn what method standard in order to exist code you will learn all method that help you your class method and video we will build our own method that just like method from rail will help you the magic behind and help you write your own similar method for your own project learn all about method that let you and class method and learn how to run code in differ scope your by fold so in video you will do just that you will learn about differ method that ha to offer to be to intercept and hook into the that happen in your class and you can add some custom behavior or valid when a is within class for is a concept but such as could have function like you have develop for rail you should have use helper in video you will build your own helper if you don\\'t want to the whole gem into your project just for you will be to write your own will go through the code from rail and explain how it is implement demo will give you an idea of how all the method learn in section work to some \\t ` method in 1 9 but you can it yourself use the method that cover task explain the ` method and the video i and walk you through the process of write method and further it \\t task some of class from the standard and ask you implement them video you will see an implement of class we will build class that of the class from the standard task you to a custom for code just like popular gem \\t in video i show a to task you will learn how can you write a code that is with the syntax a custom \\t in video we will look into the way how we can run code in scope or \\t you will learn how to share scope between differ method or class that no one can access we will go through code in code and differ way they can be implement also you will learn the reason behind those work open class is a duck type class are code global class local constant basic of to run your code',\n",

app be a full date a tinder clone must say that so far is have the assign discuss and feedback from the instructor ha been the miss that i have been look for i have read a hand of book watch hour of video & type in a bunch of and final have to work through tough assign and what i have been learn it is all start to click - final \" discuss board is one of the best for a begin develop so much help be just the which i thought a great intro to the i feel been well worth the invest move week 2 is so differ than week 1 and i like it for the an excel for who want to make their first app it enough how is help me with my skill i think use protocol and is final second finger cross am love the class i have taken class at code school & and both were miss a key element the to ask question as you a section and get an answer train is the best out there so far i wish i had the time away from regular job to follow along love i have been through at least 5 book and deal your is super so far final i can get from start to finish on a lesson without wonder on thank wait to do more take and how much time doe it take to develop and develop as a whole is a boom career the demand for new develop at all level far outweigh the barrier to is not as high as one would think - though passion and hard work are a in or other field is not aim to take you from to junior develop in three month the app you in can be use on your portfolio so you have to show when you for job learn the use to develop all and mac app a new tool that allow develop to a server side in and learn the latest platform from connect with third like and more learn how to use graphic builder core store data on your with the core data learn how to us git for version control and into your app to control flow and what is object orient program method model view control common class and draw and graphic core data control open through dock or through spotlight search a new project \\t select view in the app pane other option are tab and an that no code view allow us to have a project will all the code written that connect one plain view upon open the app fill out project data as shown in video be sure to select for and check storyboard and refer count go over what these mean in depth but for now start our project with them select is where all the file in your project are you can search for thing error and add break point among a host of other thing when you click on a file it content will be shown in the center screen to view two file at hold down the key and click a file the inspector you can add element to your you can the size and physic of those element here you error you will ) is where they show up as shown in the video all of these view can be with the three button on the top right of will be use each of these area throughout the so you will have of time to get comfort with them refer the code that written to the text is as will learn what all of mean but for know how the statement between the brace sound somewhat similar to is not by but instead a of the program in which most app are written in dot and can be read as text is equal to hello class \" right now the word sound a but bear with way of say \" play around with the inspector area on the right side of the click on your label and see if you can background to green and make the font a bit bigger the best way to learn is to so go ahead is a user element that allow for user to tap on a field and have the keyboard pop up which allow user to enter input like my name is or they want to write function like is use if you have a form in your app and you want the user to enter their email and password \\t ad one more view control object to your storyboard and then transit or in speak to that from your view control with the world on it to do you will need to add and a button in your project \\t make sure to click the as your type push can be use when use and are the that will give you a back button for free if you select like a modal then the new screen will be present with no way out you can by click the on top of the arrow that link your view control and press \\t is a great and popular way to transit from screen to screen in in fact if you take out an right now and open up a few of your app you will be to see it look out for the bar on the top of the screen section is avail in 8 have all of the asset for the in a spot in case you have find them later on name in are written to be crystal clear the method call time our view well did load hold true for all method name like and as we progress through the we\\'ll learn quit a bit about method name and how to construct them is a great tool for that might be difficult to understand upon first a lot of the time it might not be at first what a block of code doe and therefor a comment help reader of our code to understand what is be done and reader us too down the line time after write code you will have to go back to it to maintain it or fix it and code will be much easier to fix is good to get in the habit of comment out your code my comment over the top and even call you want to be comment line of code with time you will be to find your perfect comment the use so far we can add subtract and them a tip to prevent later on that algebra the must be assign from the left side for int x = + is a valid statement + 3 = int x will break your program those of you who have gotten a of syntax is a way of an object an is to hold text all you need to know for now to avoid space between name use symbol in name and use keyword like new and \\t here are some common token we will be use in the we\\'ll be go over them quit a few time so you\\'ll have of time to get comfort use them \\t for \\t for \\t for float \\t for object to refer the code against your written code the code the code can be found \\t a lot of new stuff method class method and don\\'t we will get to what all stuff is but we want you build now some rather of concept you will see later code can be found statement allow us to test is number greater than less than or equal to a for now we are just print out differ statement to our base on the logic in the in the we\\'ll have differ bit of code run base on our us with an to state think of state as a light switch which can be on or off in our program could be ha the user log in if ha then the state is ye if not then the state would be no we can test a type with a that we learn about in our last statement what is in the on a is a common error when learn program to use a what we have at our \\t time you need to your age of app to make it a more what do i mean well our convert wasn\\'t so hot 1 human year doe not equal 7 dog year so how do we it a good answer will use \\t again best of luck if you want to show the exact age the with loop allow us to repeat a set of logic a fix number of time they are use so we don\\'t have to write the same line of code over and over again out the project on good luck \\t time to start a new project again we\\'ll be do some background work for the next 4 section trust me put in the work and gain a bit of understand about the will payoff when you start code later don\\'t we\\'ll be get into build a more visual appeal soon \\t one \\t prior to 5 file were use although we discuss them right now they are way to graphic are the blueprint for how object are made think of have a blueprint for a car and have to make of them the class is the blueprint while the car are object we say that they are of the class order to make our own class all we have to do is go file new file and click class then need to name our file it is import that we start with a letter all class name begin with a letter we want to prefix our class with two or three letter to distinguish it from other class these letter are default by the class prefix we when we setup our project in the h file all other object that or import class get access to with java other mean that h file is public if a by a h and m file the h file would contain what is on the screen and the keyboard as ha access to the intern or how the would work would not be here but would be in the m all the inform that we in the h file we must also implement that inform in the m is critic to do if we tell other class that we have implement a method in our header file but do not tell the what to do the program will break order for the implement file to be of what in header file it must first import that file we import we need to give an area to write our or the method from our header file so that we know where to write code class tell you to begin with the and the class name and tell you where to stop write implement with all method must be between these two keyword \\t what you see get call just our view come on screen and therefor make great spot for set up code and test code cannot yet the object we have not import or told the class about our brand new class \\t import and that it \\t we now have access to what ha made public or it ha in it h file now we can start talk about in our the mean local while the mean system we will take a look at an of the in just a second we use which tell the import statement to find my own header \\t each of our class and file do not know about each other unless we import them their header file it is good to keep import to a minimum and do so when is the most way to an object is a class method call upon our class which return an of that class is an method that is call on our new the it for use you will differ syntax to an object the method call use and is again the most way to accomplish feat that you should be call and and never at time might be much more than code such as make sure we can repeat the step think of a that a dog ha as and add that as a to your class set your to in your method and that to make sure it set can return a that can be assign to a method in such as can return either or a we the type of the return of the follow the hyphen or symbol both and that the method doe not return you get stuck checkout the video in the next a method that take one an and print to the whole number between it and 1 it and 1 ) for if we pass in 3 your would a new method that take two both and print whole number in between them the for if you pass in 6 and 2 your would a method that with a return type and an argument that return the ( ) of a number give it a if you have not heard of be care pass in too of a number get big fast if you are have out the make a method that accept 1 argument and return an our first problem we need to a new method method take 1 of type int that we add a colon and then the type in follow by an name we have our method setup it is prudent to test if the pass to method is greater than 0 we confirm that it is greater than 0 we use a for loop to down from the to 1 each time we go through our for loop we print the current of i to our \\t our second problem we need to a new method method take 2 both of type int pay special to the syntax below each argument ha a name a type and a name for in our method below we have the \\t \\t int \\t \\t int \\t we have our method setup we need to do a bit of logic use an if if and an comparison we can test 3 bit of logic the first comparison we will do is if the two are the same in case there is no need to print out number between the two they are equal the second comparison test if the first is greater than the second in case we from our first down to our second print out each in between in our third case we from our second to the first \\t to our third problem we need to a new method method take 1 of type int but also return an our first two problem that instead of use void we put int in the at the begin of our method of our method each time we through our for loop you your answer by your current index for 5 would be equal to 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 \\t a onto our screen make sure your is a 4 inch if you the 3 5 option you might have a bit of your screen miss on your bottom the same way that car had of color and brand and dog had age and breed our view control ha an and back to m so that we can set the last of our dog we need to give the dog a so that we will be to our is of type to match that the right side of the must or return a object we know that the method take one argument in case a string which seen with with method search for an name st and it find file it convert it to a object and return object is peculiar is that is a class and not an object is therefor known as a class method a concept that will be touch on later the bright side there are two type of method so now seen both type the first type is an method which we call on object and class method which we call on class other note we move i want to that be care with spell and is to program just like an essay submit to a would be mark off for spell and the will not understand you even if you are off by one letter can be when you are start out in the long run the feedback the give you an essay submit to class where you must wait for your professor to mark out in red ink all your the can give you feedback we need to get our dog on the screen well i think we have seen similar thing the bottom of write the follow \\t check out the object each inform about a dog we use a differ name within our method although it might seem intuit it is worth repeat that we do not use the same name design differ dog more than of a method also that each of our class can set it own to further what it is or make it more after enter the code below we will have four object if we the object we previou \\t = - may be download from the handout section that we have 4 dog we need a place to store them our come in the form of a which is a contain for object we can also think of an as an order list of object a is also an object itself and is subject to all of the rule that pertain to object that we have far we\\'ll learn more about in a video we will be access our from method it is prudent to make it a local which exist the scope of a particular method retain their and name in all method in our header file the that we have a name that point to an object in order to start use our we need to or the object forget an object as a doe not mean it is among other thing an that may be access throughout the class go to the method in our m file and below our recent dog add the follow line of a contain for our dog can think of it as a kennel i still within our method add our dog object to our array to accomplish we call a method call which take a argument argument expect type of object which is we see id as the argument type we\\'ll learn more about id later but for now id is an pointer to type of object to add the \\t \\t \\t \\t name ha all of our dog object as a good use the function to print our array to the will reveal a list of address although they look like each of those correspond to a dog object our contain is work we use the token when log object is a subclass of which mean that it ha all the function of an be an is also allow to add and it own object an is an but with extra don\\'t we just use it all the time we want to access object in an we can do so by their the index is a count start at 0 that keep track of an object in an array the method is implement by and return an object for a given index that if we to access an index that doe not exist in an array there is no object at that our will crash the first index in our array is label as the index - not 1 in accord with number you are feel smart today or are crave some take a look at are just a few use method implement by and you have a take these method out for a spin and see if you can make each one work be sure to check the document for other document is a access the document you can select help from the top menu bar command + shift + ) then select the help option command + option + ) you can also hold down option and click a class name in your code - how the search bar to i would recommend take some time to look over the document for and at the least - these will appear in you will ever write better know what they are of so that you don\\'t have to write the code yourself order to the dog the on the screen there is a need for a user to be to interact with our we accomplish by ad a word for on a when the user hit button voila a new dog \\t what happen when that is press let step through the code \\t a type that is equal to the number of dog in our array \\t a between 0 and - 1 that match the of our array is a function that return a pseudo random number between 0 and number \\t we are use the modulo % to scale our random number to an size \\t that we have a random index we can ask our array to return a dog for given index \\t have our dog let our element to match \\t a we can see that we are also to alter our how although we do not have it as a of our it is pass in as an argument to our action method the button is refer to as within the method \\t the to \\t sign me up admit video is a ahead of the but who doesn\\'t like some extra credit i have to show it out the follow line of code below for your element to comment out a block of code you can first highlight it and then press and the code i said there is a lot new here but let break it down into stuff that we do know or at least can give an guess about you do not have to understand that is go on here is a method implement by wasn\\'t kid when i said had long method it is known as a class method and is call on a class and not an object we will see more of later number that is pass in after we pass about the yet the of show two look how not but it doesn\\'t take much it is to add such a complex effect as doe a lot of work for you without know what code say are good that you could have guess what is doe is meant to sound like you get stuck check out the video also plea note that the video is miss one line of code to the so check out the note video is miss a line of = below for in the code \\t when you hit the new dog button it will not show you a new dog uh oh isn\\'t what we sign up for \\t the problem is that we actual see the same dog that is when we a random dog from our array it happen to be the dog that is on screen is the first real bug that you will although there are way to fix it it will a bit of out of the box think \\t need a hint i would keep track of our current index by make a ) if we have that inform an if statement could be use to check if our new index is equal to our one \\t also interest in where the term came from feel free to check out \\t in h the \\t in our we start with the same dog is a result of the code we wrote in that set up our view as a result we need to give our current index an as well in write the follow line of code to set our index to 0 \\t great now that i have an for my i next need to my method to test if the is equal to my random index my first if statement below test if the save and the are the same it also test if the equal 0 if both of these are true we need a new number so we add one to our random index and then the view with the dog next we test if the and the random index are the same if they are we subtract one from our by subtract instead of ad we won\\'t run the risk of exceed the number of dog in our array object have a common ancestor known as in other word all the class we deal with will have base function and behavior it would be a great idea to check out it document ) you do check out the document you will that implement both the and so that class can of so is class can call these method that class progress down the class they have all the behavior of their parent and that is they gain function for an is an and more that we have a class we can add behavior to it that is particular to a a is a subclass of a dog it inherit all the function of a dog and can add to it a also ha a name breed and the other in our class a is a dog it can be use a dog is use there is no restrict in ad our to our array you have never dealt with inherit it can be a don\\'t if you are with the concept now we will inherit countless time throughout the so there is of time for it to sink in \\t while class inherit function from their parent there are time where a subclass will want to act differ that is it won\\'t share the exact function of it parent to accomplish a class can \\t a inherit the method bark from it a dog a doesn\\'t quit bark like a dog in case the need to the bark method \\t the method bark is call on a object it will respond as a would with a whimper \\t you should note that a subclass inherit all of it behavior whether public or in order for to help with the the and method must be in the header file it is to a method in a implement file is and usual frown upon the section we learn that it is to a method in our class we inherit and implement custom function for a method it is also to extend the function of a method in short for a method in our super class we can gain access to all of function and then add our own on top accomplish we use the super keyword caught a of in the m file we saw a parallel in our class we can call our implement of bark and then add our own behavior if we would like is quit common to have a subclass implement it implement of a method and in turn that implement it own implement with a sort of occur up the with a method implement behavior from ancestor stack and the heap are two main way in which data is store in we need to store our and inform so that we can pass inform around stack is for local that exist within the scope of a function such as float or are store in the stack heap is where object live object can be in size and it is more to access them through an address rather than each object ha a address which can to the * when an for = design that hold a address where the object live well right now it might be but the key takeaway is that object and are store in differ object be in size are store in the heap while are store in the stack to our is an object you call and on the class to a new one and the hold a pointer to a string object of the object we will use have in front of them like and is of that these two letter are there for the same reason we ad a class prefix to our class to avoid that we have been expo to object we are to the syntax are use frequent and ha shorthand or a liter syntax to make code easier to write and read time you have seen it shorthand for and a object an use a liter the same effect as use the and method is use so frequent it is that you check out the document in detail there are power method that have been written for we can the word in use the method method return an of string is no harm in play around with these method and see what they do let make sure we understand each line of the code again that our index word start at 0 and not 1 is a of our array start at index 0 next our upper limit is less than but not equal to the number of word in if we go over we will get an error in our origin for loop we that all object in the array are string if we had ad type of object other than to our array when we attempt to call a string method on the object our would crash i you to for yourself through the object of an array is such a popular task a quicker shorthand method is avail known as you haven\\'t been pay popular the fast way when you write an statement you are actual implement two method and an to store inform behind the scene - you do not see code in the implement file in our class we an refer to as is store as an under the name is an adopt convent when name with avail to us we are to both write set and read it get the and method that have been written when you a their correspond are as the method will allow us to the of the the name method will return the current of the the last is what we are actual read or write the itself in code the of an look that if you have all the code written your code is now synonym with your mean you can get rid of it obviou is a much cleaner approach to accomplish what is in dot is a or short hand for a method call when we use the dot on the right side of an equal sign we are implement the or the method when we use dot on the left side of an equal sign we are set the of an or use is a contain that we can use to hold object a hold these object as an order list of pointer or refer to our object store in the heap it is also mean that we our array object we will not be to add or object from it an we can use the custom to our object with a set of object is it save us from have to an and then add 1 object at a time also ha a perform over they are simpler object look below for an of our custom \\t that the last item we ad in our nil tell the program that we are done ad object do we have to do without nil our know we are done ad object and our program break a or can both accept type of object for we can actual have an array of an array is known as an emb array and is actual common in program is an of a a data type inherit from the c program in simplest form a hold or group float and under one name to a we can use the follow the of the * seen with object a is not an object access the within a we can use dot for the x of the point can be by write again that we do not use either strong or weak a not an object is to nest if statement within other if statement is common when you want some logic to as you would when the outer comparison is true nest if statement lead to code that is difficult to read to join comparison with or to code is to a button use the method we will cover in depth in a video for now stick with use option will allow you to your in code for we could my method in the class m file in with the follow bit of code can also hide the button from the user use the hidden if we set the hidden to ye the button will from the user mean that not can the user not see the button but they cannot interact with it as well set the back to no reveal the button more can also as a way of user or for lack of a better word show them an alert to an of look through the follow code for now set the to that in order to have the alert view display on the screen the method must be call on the alert view object we want to a of a given class in our header file we must first import that class into our ( stand in contrast to our import that occur in the implement file ( is import to note that you want to import into header file and when import bloat your code is more to and run then there need to and is not a good design will clearer as we begin to discuss popular design pattern in develop in it is legal to send method to \\t project will be the most assign at the end of assign you should have a understand of each of the major concept touch upon in our first two week while it might appear at first success of the assign should help you grasp key concept in program a pillar for the rest of our class \\t let me state that is meant to be a but if you break up and it in chunk is build of length will allow you to put of the concept learn so far in an context \\t when approach project we recommend work on one part at a time as such we have broken assign into part \\t you are to custom your and attempt the problem on your own view the video the do not the way to assign if your meet the then you have that problem what is offer is and clean code that may prove to be a help comparison as you work through the assign final assign is meant to take some time to \\t the at it heart is a game the should have a system we recommend start with a 4 by 3 rectangular system user should be to to differ by press one of 4 direct arrow tile are object which will the inform to our view when a valid movement is not the button should be or hidden \\t use a tile object to the inform mean a class call tile that will have that we can use to our view a a background etc you can these in header file then when you of your tile object you can set these and group inform for your view \\t the game should also a object it should have health weapon and armor stat the first two may be but the last two should be a class that you mean you will have to a armor and weapon class both of these class should have a name and or a health where \\t the view should contain at least 1 label that should display a for our game there should be at least 1 button that allow the user to do a specif action base on the current tile there should also be an area to display your stat health amount amount weapon name and armor name \\t to the tile you should implement a class sound complex but in it is straight forward the class will as an between our model and our view control we should a method that return an of tile object within method we can of our tile class and set for our tile here while not it is recommend that you 4 array that contain 3 tile object we then recommend wrap all 4 array into a array and return it from your method is call an emb method and discuss in the video \\t when user tap on the direct button the should be to which tile to make your should also the inform on the view user should also be to interact with the with the action button in the action suggest interact could pick up an weapon armor or some health effect either neg or posit \\t there should be 1 object in the at a given time and that should have 1 weapon and 1 armor therefor if an action the weapon you will have to how to the old weapon armor and effect ad the new armor and weapon inform should be display in the stat \\t to finish the you will need to a boss class like the the boss object should have a health stat so that we know when defeat the boss user should be to fight the boss on one of the tile time an action occur that may our health we should check to see if our current health is 0 the fight with the boss we should check to see if the boss health is 0 if our boss die we lose all of our health we should alert the user they have won if we die at point in the we should be alert that we lost the game \\t final the user should have a way to start over add a button to your and it reset when the user press button reset the stat to their set the start point back to 0 0 and reload the view \\t we will task for those student that want to push forward and attempt some problem on their own these are recommend and are not core to our curriculum let me stress that these are meant to be in case you will need to come up with invent or do a bit of research best of luck \\t random tile so that your game is more you start at the same place but the of the boss and is left to \\t right now if a user want to an action they can to a new tile the button for certain tile so the user must an action they can proceed for the final boss fight lock the user in so they can not retreat until they have gotten attack at least by the boss \\t add to tell a better and make it more interact for a user pick up a sword put up an alert that say user take sword \\t add an class for our an item class \\t do some with your and health number so that it is for your user to lose if they take the wrong path but also for them to win if they take the correct path through your game \\t part set up the storyboard a basic tile object and a \\t part between tile ad a background and the \\t part ad weapon and armor and ad their effect to our project \\t part ad a action to our \\t part final boss and reset \\t the recommend step below are not the way to assign as much as you can and the assign base on the and use section when you get stuck or are of how to proceed \\t the first thing we need to do is setup our view set up our view will give us an idea of where project is head and will hope get us think about how our interact with our view \\t take a look at the assign video for feel free to take some artist ) the background is a and as a nice touch i set my contain object to be partial i set the on them to alpha may be found in the inspector and ha a between 0 and 1 \\t although our tile object will be use to our view we recommend you start with a basic until you can get the tile as you on your system \\t final you should your class the method should look like \\t \\t i recommend 4 array that each have 3 tile object like \\t = \\t = \\t = \\t = \\t then an array to hold each \\t = \\t now that we have a setup we should use it to our tile array in our view control we also need to setup an point for our user to start at in our system i recommend use a for both in the h way will be to access your current point in all method as well as your tile \\t forget to a we use the syntax \\t each time we set a new tile as our tile we need to hide button that are invalid to do we can use the hidden for that will hide the button on the screen can be set to a ye or no i recommend put into a method so that we can function throughout our \\t we should call method in so that when our view is setup our west and south button will be hidden \\t we should run a test on all 4 button to if they are valid can be accomplish by take our current point and either ad 1 to x ad 1 to y subtract 1 from x or subtract 1 from y on new point we have to perform 4 test if the point pass all 4 test it is a valid or if it fail of them the tile doe not exist we should check to make sure that our y point is greater than or equal to 0 and that our x point is greater than or equal to 0 to confirm that our point is our lower bound to test our upper bound we should check to make sure that our x point is less than the count of our tile array we should also check to make sure that our y point is less than the tile array contain we can access tile array tile \\t now that you are to hide your button you need to actual implement the function for each of your connect to the arrow button if for the user press the north button the current point with self = x self \\t final you have the between tile work which you should be to confirm visual on your storyboard as your should from read 1 to + time to you add a background to your tile object and make your more explicit then use that inform your view \\t it is import to learn about class and one of your class as a in class \\t first a weapon and armor class the weapon class should have of and name of type int and respect the class should have of health and name of type int and respect \\t now you can a class a weapon armor and health in order to a of type weapon and armor you will need to import both the weapon class and armor class into your header file not your implement file \\t next an of in your you should setup some set your start with a weapon or armor you should give your an amount of health and you can to give you the will have to import into header file your method might look like \\t \\t that we are return a from method the need to import our class into our header file \\t final in your h file a so you will be to access throughout your class then your in you should finish by your inform onto the view \\t now that we have a of our and we can through our time to add action to our \\t start by your tile for your header file should now have a a background an a weapon armor and health effect \\t now in our we can setup our tile to all of these for a tile in our might now look like \\t now our tile know that action is to a specif weapon or armor or health effect all your tile so that they have an so that we can our in our storyboard also add armor a weapon or a health effect \\t when think about where to implement function that we have an call it would make sen here to test if the current tile ha either a weapon armor or a health effect with it here use an if if and statement we should be to test which our tile object ha for \\t that we first our health by the old armor ad our new health benefit then we our current armor to the tile armor \\t a boss class it should have a health depend on your implement it may also do or you may as a health effect as part of the boss a method in your that return one boss \\t as we did with our object i would recommend have one boss in our class we will need to track health stat for the life of our view control so it would be prudent to make our boss a you can use your to setup your boss in the method \\t time you do an action you should test if your health is less than 0 now that you have a boss you should also do an if statement to test if the boss health is less than 0 final it would be great if the user were alert if their health fall below 0 in which case they lose or if the boss health dip below 0 in which case they can claim i would recommend use a \\t if you sure how to do check out the video and you can see it done by hand order to get our work we need to setup our we should adjust the background for each of our we will our view we will start with the stat we will be the right column of label so you can name these that is help to you next is to the action final we need to is the let add 4 button that will as our compass point make sure to add these onto of the but below the up all of your view element to your header file for organ i recommend keep all of your and the will use our tile object to our object we will start by ad two won\\'t be use the for quit a while but will hope be a hint as to the view object that we will need to by inform we will be to access one tile object to our and at the same time will be use a to our tile object there are a of reason to a but in term it let us keep the tile creation in class of the in short our will have less code and will be free to do task of the view the h file a method that return an array of our tile object the tile that will make up our game i tile object for now we\\'ll the background and the name blank to allow us to test and make sure that our tile are we will use a default with tile number we will group the tile into contain or array each contain will as a column in our system we can group all of these contain so that the number of contain we add to our array will be equal to the number of column in our system also use a shorthand here for our final array instead of an and ad object after the fact we an and it with object the method is a custom that allow us to the tile array with all of the contain we can then return tile array from our method now when we an of and call the method tile on that we get an array of contain back the m implement the method tile read more about the design pattern check h we\\'ll two the first one will be a that will keep track of our current in our system we also will an to store our tile array m we will setup our we will first set our current point to a at 0 0 mean that when the user start our game they will begin at the lower left hand corner of our system we use the function which accept two float we want to use whole number for our system so you can enter whole number into the function as well next we will our object and call the method tile on it it return an that we can set equal to our tile we can a helper method to our view we now have a current point with two we can index into our tile array which return a of tile then we can index into the return array and get a tile we set the return object to a then we can use the to our we access the tile and set it equal to our text we need to use our helper method our tile by call the method in make sure to call the method after self tile = if we attempt to call the method hand the method would not work the self tile ha not yet been set the doe not yet exist need to two method the first method will accept a and tell you if a tile exist at that point the method will return a which will whether or not we should hide the button if the method return no the button should not be hidden if the button is current hidden it if our method return ye we should hide the button our if statement will test to confirm that the x and y are greater than 0 will confirm that the test point doe not go below our lower bound to test our upper bound we will confirm that the count of the total number of array in our tile array is greater than our x point we also need to confirm that for the chosen array of our tile array that count is greater than the y point if all of these are true than the tile exist and we return no the tile doe not exist and we return ye we need to a method call we will test each button to see if it should be hidden or not the method return a as to whether or not we should set the hidden of our button to ye or no the we pass in should test the current point if a tile exist to the north south east or west of our current point our view at 0 0 should allow the user to go north and east let use our method to hide the west and south button call the method in at the bottom of the method the user press a valid button we need to our current point valid button and the inform on our view we our current point if we press the north button for our y point by 1 now that our current point is at a new we need to which button are valid from call the method to or hide base on need final we can our view with the new tile the method find the current tile base on the current point it is import that we our current point use function m let our tile object first add the to your project make sure that the project target is select next the 1 2 etc is bore that our tile object have been let them in our view in our method add the follow line of code at the need to both a weapon and an armor class we will use these class to object that will have both a name as well as a and health effect for weapon and armor respect we start with these class we will be a in our next video the will have a of weapon and armor allow it to these both weapon and armor make sure to subclass the header file should have the follow that we have a weapon and armor class we can a class we will use an of class to store the player inform will a weapon armor health and a new class that is a subclass of first thing we need to do is import both and into our in the past we have import in the implement file and of class as need in case we want to that are of class weapon and armor in order for our header file to be of these file we need to import them into our h file add the follow import into your h let setup the for our class could our in the m file in order to stick with the design pattern been use so far let our in the we\\'ll be return an of our from a method we need to import our class that we have our method setup we need to implement our method first we an of our class then we setup for our these will be the our player will start with at the begin of our game we setup our health to next we need to an armor object an of our armor class and assign a name and a health stat the class ha a of armor we can set our armor to the armor object we we can do the same for our weapon by an of our weapon class we want one object in our class at a time and we want to be to access all of our method it is prudent to make our a we will be in our header file we will need to import our class in our that we have a of class we need to set it up or give it an a great place to setup is we know our object will be all other method in class will be call after we a method in our class to return a object we setup method to give our such as armor and we use our earlier to our tile object we do not need to in the add the follow line of code after the creation of our object we need to the so that our view can now show our health armor and weapon add the follow line of \\t in order to add weapon armor and health effect to our we need to our tile object the data in our tile class mean that tile object will have of weapon armor a health effect when our user press the action button we can from our current tile what effect should be to the we will use these to the armor weapon or the \\t we need to the tile header file to these new don\\'t forget to import both the weapon and armor class we\\'ll be with these class \\t now that our tile object ha we need to our class the class is for our tile object in the follow we add a weapon armor or a health effect to each of the tile we can the that we made to our tile in the last section a good first step would be to the we both an and an for our action button therefor we can use our for our action button to the of our button at the end of our method add the follow line of order to our we use the method method accept 2 the first one is an which we set use our the second argument expect a control state we will learn about control state in the for now use should now the next to our tile class that we need to implement is the weapon armor or health effect let a method that accept 3 armor weapon and of method we will use if statement to test if a valid object or number is be pass into our method if it is then we adjust our do we have to test if the object exist when we our tile object we were not to add a weapon armor or health effect for all of our tile we ad one of these we don\\'t want our method to all of the we want for the valid can use nil as a to test if an object exist it is a pointer to or at all in effect by say object nil we test is the object exist our health effect is an we test if it is equal to 0 instead of nil we use nil to test if object exist now we add an statement at the end of our method in the event that is nil or 0 is the case when we first run our the user ha not press the action button we want to setup our by factor in the effect of the weapon and armor current for our accomplish all of these item we can add a helper method of the m file we have a method that will use our there are two we should method the first is in so when our first run our armor and weapon stat are account for in add the follow line of that we pass in the argument of nil nil and 0 as a result our statement will trigger also want to call method when the user press the action button in case we should use the armor weapon or health effect we ad to our current tile object should be a hint that we will first have to out what our current tile object is we have a of tile that we setup in we can access use the syntax self tile and index into array use the method we use our current point to access the proper tile final we\\'ll use the return as the argument for the the follow code in the method name order to implement our final fight with the evil boss we need to a class to model it a class that is a subclass of name boss it is add a of type in that ha a name health that we have a boss class let setup the in our our method will return an of our boss class be sure to import the boss class in our header file want to setup our boss in the same way we setup our in our class we want 1 boss in our at a time and we want to be to access that in all of our method of the class as a result we should a of our boss class in our header file and than we can our boss in the method that we have a boss we need to health our final fight in the method we will first test if we are on the tile a to out would be to check if the health effect is if it is then we know we are in the final that boss doe to us time we attack him i will note that is far from a perfect to check which tile we are on if tile had a health effect of we could our program into think we were fight the boss when we were on tile is fast and to cement if statement so we\\'ll with it we confirm that we are on the final tile we the boss health by subtract from it that we have our boss fight setup let alert the user if they die or if they defeat the boss we will use an object we use the custom which accept a few for now we will use for all of these the first one is a which will appear at the top of our next we will send a to the user we won\\'t be use a for now we have not learn about them yet so set it equal to nil we need to also give a way for the user to close the which is known as the cancel button button need a which we set use a string final we will not have other button so we set option equal to nil we have our object setup we need to call the method show on the so that it will appear on our screen last step of our assign is to a reset button for our add a to your storyboard and hook it up as an action to h of method add the follow code to reset our adjust we can make to clean up our project is to group like method in the implement file use mark we can keep our code organ and easier to allow us to type in command into our shell and interact with our is a way to through our file and enter in git command - list all file and in the current to name with space that if your ha space like name with space make sure to use the proper forward and backslash project - make a call project test - an file name test - ls allow us to list content of a file the of the flag that tell the list to print out all file and even the hidden one - allow us to to the the current + c - to abort a long run command enter in - by itself will take you back to the home - the file name be care with it won\\'t move our file to the trash it will it setup git for our project make sure to your project with version control a on if you wish to keep your code make sure to select option in order to have a you must sign up for a paid account use git to the proper where you have your project store add - stage your for the next commit commit - commit the stage file to the the with the add origin - set up our local to be push to our we set our name to origin and a after push origin master - the push command tell git where to put our file origin is the name of our and the default branch we\\'ll be use is master the tell git to the our code is on made to our project we want to be to push to make sure you are in your project like our git process we need to type a few git command add commit push origin master process is to our process but we setup some we don\\'t have to do step from order to download project we can download the zip and extract it to our desktop we can also do in use the command git clone make sure that you are in the proper where you want to download the project to clone is a popular not design pattern use to make the acronym stand for model view and control to the design pattern give a to code that limit strong depend and allow code to be move around we call code \" model in is the data or concept behind your is not what the user see but it is the inform govern your in a game would be the score rule and number of level view on the other hand is what the user see and interact with you have drag and drop view object into your storyboard control is usual a and is in of link or between the model and view the middleman design pattern the model and the view should allow the model and view to be and can move around you have seen how use the code for a or - no depend control ha access and can with both the model and view seen the control the view in our demo take the best friend for the control had a on the view and as well as the model it the to the and object on our view correspond to our model again the control is the middleman did the control with both camp well first the control import the class allow it to access method and second the control import ahead check the top of your h file ) the framework contain the logic behind etc again the control ha open access to and know about both the model and the view doe our view let our control know ha occur on the screen for when a button is tap is a view are not to know about their control in between a view and a control is blind between the object current in the we will discuss two way in which blind type of occur first is known as when we hook up our button via to our we an where a place on our the button tap it shot a or at the target again the import aspect of is that the sender button for doe not know what it is send it to is import well to blind to avoid depend allow a to function with other class don\\'t if isn\\'t sink in with will the of type of clear although good to be think about now second type of is known as an object such as a can the to object such as a when a view need to know it will ask for inform process is also blind - the in our case ha no idea what kind of class it is type of will be a key in our next where we will use the class model can also talk to the control in a blind fashion we will back to later but in case you are interest right now and would like to do some research is through the and a process call check them out if you are is a it is a compo of a column with number of row although it sound it might be the most import class use to display inform to our user so popular you open an app right now from your are good you will see one not is is use but it is a textbook use to and view to control doe a work is a view object for organ and show data it ask our what to display and in turn our our model get to it and see instead of all jabber are two way we can add a to our use the builder the first and easiest way is by ad a to our storyboard file an method that we will see later is a more and ad a object of our hook up our as our manual and a bit more work than use our as soon as you subclass a a in return to the storyboard file select the in the scene and find the inspector the in your class to match your mint subclass in m file quit a few method chief among these method are the data method the data which is our in case is for tell our how cell to display and what those cell should look like three method touch on inform our the number of cell in each section to display the number of section and what to display in each row a new project and name it of \" if you don\\'t know who dog is i would recommend you check him out on a a and a in your project those element onto your view in your storyboard make the connect similar to what we did in unit convert to from our element into the h file of our our end goal is to convert a number we enter in our text field a number of to a larger number dog you can find common go ahead and write logic extra a on your and put in a of checkout the info section for a of although we will go over the answer in a later video it is import that you these i you that is where the real learn is done so give it a shot i wouldn\\'t lie to you if you have feel free to ask some question on the discuss board and if you get stuck check out the video there is no shame in it if you are feel overwhelm or just make sure you code out the and then it without the video the method when your is to use the real for dog year is follow each human year equal 5 dog year for the first two year and then 4 dog year for each human year after sound like a word problem well it is you will find yourself frequent take what is ask of you and that into code in your project use a for loop print the song of on the wall if you don\\'t know the give it a quick the point of the song is to repeat a set of lyric the number of sung with each round you might not want to your at 0 or 1 for take as a hint method group code in order to a particular goal are sent to an object or class in order to act upon them or get them to do for method we use the syntax for class method we use the syntax to make a method public so that it will be in other class we must our name in the header file in the class that will implement the method implement a method mean the function for that method method name that start with a hyphen are known as method the in statement that the method doe not a return will be cover in a later section either your method name from your header file or take of function to the method name in your header ( file and your implement file ( are forget to the semicolon and add left and right brace to implement the method in the m file for the class in question code written of the brace will when the method is call code is the logic of the method method can take and perform logic differ accord to those the sign at the begin of a method design the type of method a hyphen is for method while a is use for class method the in front of the method our case far it ha is known as the return type a colon in a method name an argument after the colon we give a type for the argument such as and a name in order to access the or local in our implement of the brace of our method or our implement we have access to the pass in time we call method we will an argument of the type the syntax look like for if we add a such as a name we can also chain use our dot syntax for the class a text which can be use to the text of a label we can therefor access our own use use sound at first well like concept in program see a of is the real way to get your ahead around it method can have argument the argument are with the method name which is differ than method in other you may have the syntax for argument for an method might look like the the name or how it would be refer to is the method take three refer to as write long method name can be method name sound much like and by type each we know the type of argument that must be use to success call a method also drag two label to the bottom of the screen the blue line that come up to

and the team the of mind to know that to the system can be made with short is design to be like a train session where the user can come in know how to program in java and know how to unit test against their java code the time you\\'ll know how to a unit test as well as understand the differ use in test along with the valid command to to write good test will help you to learn how to use as a driver for all of your develop effort go forward with a approach we our standard viewpoint of how we write code now not do we think about do i make code work \" we also think about do i break or more often happen when the user or system doesn\\'t play nice with our code \" is to take you from hour to depend on how much of the work you do on your own or just use from the the lesson and build from the ground up but the last few lesson could be done in order depend on your need ever wonder how to get start with unit test is the for you would also be good for look to implement test in and exist develop effort video is a to our and an overview of what is to come video we discuss what you will and won\\'t learn in as well as some expect about the amount of time it will take to go through video is the first part of two part of an to test in part we go over some of the major argument against test and talk about how test is actual import even if there is a bit more work up front \\t in video we our to test by discuss some test and the unit test we also look at the differ assert and how we\\'ll use assert to pass or fail the unit test \\t in video we go over creation of the unit test in and start our person object and test on the person object work from the ground up after we get the test class and in place we begin our test by test the person class constructor are two set of file for video the starter pack and the finish code i recommend start with the starter pack and work along with me if you get stuck there are some text file that contain finish version of the code in both project if you are press for time and just want to review or if you have the video and want to check your work take a look at the finish version to result or see the end result of part of the project video we our look at test by ad the test and then code the and for our person class there are two set of file for part of the project i again recommend use the starter pack and work along with me the finish version is there for your as well video we test our person object by write the test to the method is work as expect just contain our expect use the contain method of the string class if you need to do more thorough test like valid a specif format you could do that here as well there are two set of file for part of the project i again recommend use the starter pack and work along with me the finish version is there for your as well video we start our of how we\\'ll go about test the which will implement in the person class method can be to implement so we\\'ll take some time plan we get start some good thing to think about will be what input can be sent to the method what specif we want to return and what the order of will be for if one person is greater than less than or equal to person is an import to implement when we are go to be order object it is that an object like person would need to be order by last name then first name and we\\'ll care about age as well we take all three into account in class find the plan spreadsheet and document that i use attach to video for your refer video we go over the implement of the and take the time to work through some of the test the amount of test need would go far too long for the video so a set of instruct exist that allow you to follow through with all the test and learn more about the process with the other test session i recommend get the starter pack and work through to the end the finish code is also avail for you to review video we take the time to discuss how the equal method work and how we can it and test it in our person class again we\\'ll benefit from our grid that help us see which case we need to on for to if two person object are equal video we take a look at write the code and test for the method again we\\'ll do part of it in the video but up to you to it with other video in section we have both a starter and finish version of the project there is also a document for ad test and code to and person class video we take the time to look at how we can test except in 4 with 4 except test we can use the ) to specif the except class that we expect should happen when our code is an and make test for except are some thing to for an except happen test code will stop so we don\\'t want to put test code after the line in our test that we expect to trigger the except we\\'ll need to write a specif test for each except that we expect could happen in method if there are except that could happen make sure to write a test for each one we need to to also check to make sure valid code

faster develop \\t set up a use on a server \\t upload a local site to a site \\t an page to display develop \\t set up the logo and top menu with \\t set up a blog on own page \\t the text use differ

of the site work on all browser and all tablet laptop etc ) \\t design and layout a blog page with thumbnail \\t a contact page with a contact form \\t an email subscript list and sidebar form with to join \\t display a for your site for the address bar well as for touch and \\t much more \\t the link to are link so i may therefor a if you make a of for the theme framework if you do thank you and you can find it that way \\t i would say that of the is so i would take to have the theme framework \\t design is ideal for wish to a i have gone into in great detail so no need to if you have of if you are a web design will teach you how to make a by dig into the code to you to get a site look and act how you want it to \\t the would be use for who wish to run their own web design as you would be to fee for a like 3 is the home page it is usual better to show a client what a will look like the develop stage start here are a few trick for visual in a document in the video we one pixel wide with margin either side the width and height can be or later with size make sure at i usual center the design within that are align left with the browser window ) draw by drag them out from the ruler on the side of the document if you see the ruler go zoom in zoom out can the by go the of the on the is view at a of obviou you will want to work on your design at the can be seen in at the top of the window when deal with logo or graphic element within a design it is better to use vector not raster graphic so when past in your logo benefit of smart object in is that you can click their icon in the layer and edit the graphic in is save the smart object in the document if smart object ha been and use time in the design arrow an icon a graphic a web page can have over a differ element and you will need to be to select them and group of them in order to move them around so group all your layer into layer group of the main area of the page footer sidebar etc ) will make thing easier if the client say we have the sidebar on the side one is that as you work down the page from top to bottom on the document the layer end up stack the other way round i found a way around yet we all love layer style for the to add drop shadow glow gradient etc on to almost it is use when the text shadow effect in browser to use the tool press the i key and click on the area you want to the color from then click on the foreground color at the bottom of the tool bar to open the color picker you then get a hex version of the color that you can use in your mark up click to if you want to access exact color in the design explain if you are work for a client how to best display the visual to the client so that pass the design final finish the page and you save it out as a what do you do do you just send the to the client no put it in a web page for the client to look at in a browser so no as to how it look also a good idea to add hover state or in the page so the client know what get here is the i use to show a center in a you have to enter a height on the contain div if the page is deep the client be to scroll down save it as along with the in a folder on your use and send the link to the client when the client come back with comment just the file as and forget to the name and allow refer to earlier version so download start a new on download put the folder in find the folder with your browser by type run through the process in the of the video but it can be call root all the rest it done here i explain the crucial differ between a child theme and a theme framework i often ask the visitor at my what they would like to me write about and the most common subject mention is make your own theme is a power publish platform which can be made to act and look like just about kind of theme are a collect of and file that the design or of your but they also do much more than that they can also the way the site and the differ for differ page etc there are two main way to a new theme for use a theme framework make your proof as these framework will be along with the core so no way your site will stop work when you the benefit of use a framework is that the core theme code is done and done right when you your own custom theme you are for so if wrong up to you to fix of the lead light in i use to theme from scratch but when i want to add to them like nest comment for i found it would conflict with element of the theme and fix it would mean start again from scratch even if you think you know you will be ask to do not quit sure how to accomplish when use a theme framework like you have the support of thousand of top develop and them there is bound to be who know the exact and best to here are some other of use theme been ye use link in so if you make a through one of the link i may get a i would never recommend to you that i use myself and is i use here is video where i \\t you can and download the \\t you have up and run you need to your theme framework and your child theme you will get your of as soon as you make the it and put it in the folder which as you know can be found in your file no need to touch that folder ever again all your theme will go in your child theme \\t and then to load your child theme download a child theme from the or \\t you may want to the child theme by the folder name and edit the style and the function but put the child theme next to the theme in the folder and it in the \\t of the you make to the child theme will be to the file the other ad custom page certain element from certain page ad area etc these can all be put in the function file here is the \\t if you add code to the make sure below the \\t about get your hand with the to you have of will either be in the document or will be sort out in the forum there are also a of ( lot to get through the page in just go page > add page ) a menu and drag the page to where i want them to go in the menu top menu use to be the bane of my exist but now ha in place the to have a and menu for particular i got rid of the and menu use the theme set and ad the menu in the header widget there is also the to the style of the current page link the hover link the link and the link with you can have menu for child and then link for grandchild you can have these on both the and menu here is my video where you can a page to be a child or grandchild page under parent in the page editor and when you look at the page page > all the child and grandchild page are indent underneath their parent do will also give them a logic to get these page to appear in the menu you just have to drag and drop them into their respect posit in appear > menu again child page are indent under their parent forget to give the menu a name for and set it to be the menu so page in the appear > menu area like will a menu with like plea see the video for a of is be on the i a static home page and a blog page by the set in set > read in a discuss of the differ between a static page and a blog page for the home page a full width page in is be on the i a some that in the menu make sure child page have the correct in the you can actual make as page from the drop down page use method as we don't have a background on site we haven't set one but i explain how to do anyway lot more and here find and to the link color in a menu item give a page a differ to the main head usual they are the same is be on the the first time i saw widget i thought on earth are these useless of do now i think that widget are build that should have pride of place in toolbox widget are self contain bit of code that can be to a area via an intuit a fresh of will give you some widget that you can into your sidebar for and more as you are no doubt the recent post widget is one of the most wide use widget but you can also add other widget in your sidebar by way of certain plugin for the list is endless i of use is the reason you should be use widget not for you to but i of use as a is a great way to a client to edit and page but widget allow level of client interact where they can control other static area of the such as the header sidebar and footer here is an i wrote about ad to with widget client can how post in which get list on an to be with thumbnail and the run order in which all these element appear and all is control within an intuit face it it get much more that the widget area well as said widget are almost too to use that they bear explain if you go into appear > widget on the side of the you will see a list of avail widget in the central area and a select of area on the right sidebar or header and to place a widget in a particular area guess it drag the widget from the avail widget area to the sidebar the then you can the of the widget you may like to the latest post widget recent and the set of the widget you can the number of post or in the latest post if you the area in the widget the element appear on the page without a head so for here is a screen shot of me move and here are the to use set as you can see i set the head to be and get it to display the 5 most recent post with a pixel thumbnail if you want to get rid of a widget drag it from the area back to the avail widget area if you want to take it away from the area but would like to save the set as you may want to use it again drag it to the widget area underneath and sit there until you want to use them again i use my chrome develop tool and here is the style for the widget obviou the of do you find widget difficult or to use is there you want to be to do with widget that you found out how to do yet if so i want to know i think widget are a great way to add client control over area that have been is be on the but what if you want the head or background of one of the widget to be differ to the other no problem by use the chrome develop tool > develop > develop or so for the recent post widget on blog is wrap so if you want to the color of the head case in the code the dot the differ between and in use text widget you want to add a in the sidebar to alert client that you are take new project drag a text widget over to the sidebar and type text widget can take so you can add form use text widget for my with link box etc ) form box code and all sort of sidebar good you may think that system of widget is i would say that the is true it actual add you can use also you can put a specif on each sidebar by use and with as you will know take load speed into account when rank page also i hate wait for site to load so i want to these header button with a minimum amount of and more request here i have social media icon and all of them have state that mean there could be request for just for these button the small but the request to get the that can sever page load so how do we cut down those request by one big here is the sprite i use to the social media button and their hover final here is the list of button you join me in one of these place do you have social media link in your sidebar or header how did you them what do you think of mine are they the right shape and in the best posit more to style up the footer and also as to we have the function front and style as they were at the end of the video is a import video as it us to use in the function of the child theme to the way the theme work you can get the site of page to look and differ without touch the core file you never touch the core file as they get ad widget area to the home page in order to add our slider plugin widget in order to get start will work if you have in the last lesson we bear in mind the slider pull in the first from the post or page it all the the same size to avoid discuss of of and head and more to style them up more and more of our is be access by of us have been stuck with a of to pixel wide which smaller would in size the user would have to zoom in and out to access part of the site away from the site never to return ) in a word ye a web design should respond to a need rather than the other way round i know of no other tweak that made in the last 6 year that ha the simplest way to test a against differ size screen is to your window and see what happen go ahead and narrow the browser window on and see the design respond to the width of the browser have a look at one of the best in my opinion is and here is my test with the if see scroll bar with your site you might start think about design well there are a of to make a the way of do it but it is the best and simplest come across first of all you need to add to the head to stop the from scale the whole to fit screen i show is ad in the function so that it come out in the head of page other than that a question of ad media to your to adapt your to differ size of browser window is pixel wide when view on a monitor if the site is view on a narrow than pixel the design would be pretend the first media we add is for the whole is sit within a contain div so now the will or stretch to fix the width of the browser if it is less than pixel wide with site ha to respond get the to size to the window is put in the main and for the video i use a plugin is the most common on the internet and with great popular come risk of attack manual is much safer than use a script like of theme and plugin the likelihood for for a certain host the thumb which led to thousand of blog be hack i know what i want to well as you can see from video of the best way to learn how to manual is to consult you can also see in my video how all you have to do with the to extract data and display it through web page most user will have no direct with the how you a depend on your host popular host when edit if you are use on a mac go to between plain text and rich text edit the plain text have format icon you may need to contact your host to get the correct name for the need in been do local so far and i have the site how i want it so time to put it on the host here is video on there are other way of do by export and import the for but method work for me basic you have a local and a you just the file and export and import both the to do an under construct page you need the under plugin lot of tweak to do is the case with new is be on the same as ad the slider as well as the on the home page here we add three post widget first thing we do is a new size which we can add to the function if you want to a differ size of than the default of pixel and pixel by you can by ad the follow to the a of pixel wide by pixel high of ad to post from now on the ha the name in the widget of be come on to widget later what on earth are widget widget are way of ad content to part of a the usual area where use widget is the sidebar but use widget in other area of a site as their is to explain to client so in order to our three widget with and excerpt on the home page we first need to three widget area and we do that by ad the follow code in the code three the moment widget area that will be on the right hand side if you go into appear > widget in the see the same three new widget area and allow them to be display on our home page in order to a custom home page we a text file and text file we now have the < < function { if ( ) ) { function ) { = return } } } function { if ( ) ) { ' ) } } function { if ( ) ) { ' ) } } function { if ( ) ) { ' ) } } function { if ( ) ) { ' ) } } function { if ( ) ) { ' ) } } we then add 3 more post to the blog with an in them we then add the post widget in the three new widget area we put on the home page you actual add content to the widget via the appear > widget section in the you can drag what you want into these widget area menu tag cloud list a calendar a search bar here we are use the post widget that come and the differ between the three post widget set in the of post to

the goal of make the most by make more approach we hope to to with we that ha \\t in teach you the of and you to entrepreneur who have been fund by ten of million of dollar the capitalist behind them and some of the brightest in silicon valley all of whom will give us their insight into how can the world \\t if heard of but still quit understand what it is or are interest in how new ha the power to transform the today then is for you \\t come join us at the \\t so to begin start by address the what is \\t when talk about in the media is refer to as a type of digit or virtual while of is correct also a one \\t at most basic level is a protocol if not familiar with protocol they are basic set of rule that govern how inform is transfer between protocol allow across the internet to link to form a network \\t about the protocol is that of research into have in a way to send digit inform in a manner that is safer and more than ever \\t the of how accomplish a later in the but for now we want to paint a clearer of what network doe and import \\t the most way to think about is to it as an ledger are some good video on that are help for visual learner check out the supplement to for an ) you know what a ledger is an excel spreadsheet record all of the transact happen with now instead of that spreadsheet be on your be maintain by connect to the network and each ha it own more set a ledger record all transact would be maintain by a trust central like a bank and the transact would be flow through that with a ledger though connect to the network use the protocol in keep a and public record of transact happen on the network the system is open and public with an internet connect can use the network to transact with in the world on ledger without have to go through a bank in ledger the are the unit be count and record in the transact or sell a product or in for access to the ledger so on our excel sheet we be track the movement of dollar from to but rather the movement of you have you can transact with over the network with your transact part of the ledger a ledger like is an new form of payment system it allow in the world who is connect to transact with who is connect for by transfer ownership of the correspond and have it be and record on the ledger \\t while the of may best be understood by it as a ledger it is also import to understand as a digit it is a way to money or asset with no trust in way it like digit cash if you have the money you can pay with it if you you \\t as a digit it is base on two use of the payment system today - which is basic the amount and of payment run through the ledger - and on use of the payment system \\t often misunderstood that ha some and then are trade with instead it is more that can transact with in an way and as a result it ha \\t import not to get hung up on the specif of at a given point in time in they are more of a to get trade within the ledger system ledger system then in in direct to the number who are use it \\t in other word like most network both more and more use the larger it get and the more wide adopt it a lot of pay to the price of but isn\\'t the or it but the of the which seamless global transact for the first time ever \\t relationship is a bit more than law suggest the of a network with the of the number of user if about it check out the link in the supplement to chapter for some discuss of and law \\t mention the fact that allow to transact with they trust but take a moment to discuss a more \\t transact have upon both be to trust that the transact would occur as expect \\t when make a transact in person - with cash or by barter - both can do their own on whether the transact is for if trade my shirt for your shirt it would be clear to both of us that both the shirt actual exist and that we are in fact them \\t as payment method have and have start transact over greater the prospect of trust the other ha play a larger and larger role \\t what happen is that instead of transact with the other the transact occur through a central like a bank bank and similar step in to trust concern by both with some that the transact is and that the fund get from person to person as plan \\t for now in have not found a way to trust and payment have never from payment platform while the internet ha the speed and of interact it ha lack \\t for transact the of for ha been take a look at phone call for \\t phone and internet base call have made it much easier for to interact with each other around the world rather than need to be tether to a wall can make call while on the go and across greater than ever \\t and internet base call are far less than land line call are often drop fail to connect or have poor their make them more use to so more popular in spite of their lower of \\t that to a transact \\t if i call you and the call drop not that big of a deal i can just call you right back \\t if i were send you money - and that money never made it to you - that would be a big deal go to send 1 million dollar go to want as much of a as that the transfer will be success \\t where bank - and other central - step in normal when send money over the internet we will work with a bank to perform the transact and the bank will fee to against payment not go through or one of the be \\t final allow us to make and transact over the internet without on bank the fact that the internet and those who use it can be of gave a great present to a great supplement to ) of trust ha been in length by scientist in fact such an import concept that it even ha it own the problem understand the problem a group of of the camp with their troop around an the must on to with each other and in order to success attack need to on one common plan one or more of them may be traitor who will to the other so they cannot send to each other the problem is to find an algorithm to that the loyal will reach agreement and be to launch a success attack action by the traitor term of the problem pose the question of how to establish trust between over an network like the internet more specif how can use the internet to transfer a of digit to internet user in such a way that both safe and as go back to our is ask how they can without fear that are be lost or alter by the traitor while been discuss in the context of transfer digit money the could to other type of digit from and contract to ownership of physic asset like car or approach problem by give and user code these code are what are record on the ledger and ownership of a is by match a user code to a code is then record in what is call the which is the digit ledger that in the network maintain expand on a later in the but the basic are that if of the network record ownership then it is as and a part of the go forward of threshold is that in order to do a fake transact and have it work that person would need to control enough process power to gain control of more than of the network which is a amount and as the network grow back to the now that discuss at a high level what is and how it work take a moment to it in the context of the today is as that can be use as a medium of between equal of work and in way money can act as a store of a unit of account and as a medium of discuss how function as both a and as a payment system use to understand how ha transfer over have adapt differ medium to transfer them and each of these method ha respond to in the method that them use the barter system in which they trade they own for they want medium of in system rang from livestock to grain to depend on what group had in or need from other of these good is not in way rather the have the to inspect the good and their there is also no manner of if one their mind after the deal is quit limit for a few reason first it on have need a of want as it is often there may be an of a common of between the item are not and final perish good in limit of the barter system led to the rise of as a method of transact gold the most popular to use it physic what made gold so good to use is not too much of it will last over time and more to and distinct hard to gold use much like barter there must be a physic of gold for the transact to occur and there is no avail after a transact is also no central author the of gold rather maintain a belief that gold will remain in the in it present while it more to trade with gold than to barter were still limit store and transport gold can be difficult gold not began develop paper money to act as for easier use in the us cash back by a set amount of gold gave way to the fiat money we see today instead of a one to one relationship between paper note and a physic govern that the paper note have and can be use in system the of cash is root in the trust have for govern is back the way is a return to a that is back by it own use as gold is for it physic is for that make it what it is is import to distinguish the protocol from the the protocol ledger for transact that discuss and in order to use the ledger you have to buy some it is the access and to use ledger system for transact that an to while the exact of a might as the system grow and the of the protocol will drive the of the so we can see that use a virtual all that how have transact in the past we still address it might be more to use though \\t of the problem with the exist payment platform stem from the fact that they on central to transact \\t as we discuss transact have upon some of trust in order to trust that money is be transfer we have on central like bank to the transact \\t that come at a price \\t for one the of these payment platform is old and to use lead to have to transact fee to cover their own cost to use system like or the transact fee to pass these cost down the line to merchant and friction \\t in to pay to use the payment rail transact fee are bloat by cost with against credit card fraud bad debt pay for custom support reward program and the cost of cover actual pay off their credit card \\t often lead to credit card fee of for normal transact with cut go to the bank and payment processor import to note that these rate have remain rel the same for \\t think of in the space would find a way to drive those price down but there ha been no real in the space that ha been to accomplish they all on the same system and the bank are with the is where the network concept is so import as bank are no longer a to transact the high cost of transact fee ha been a drawback to the payment platform is not free of fee when send a transact over the network you depend on one of the miner to confirm your transact and add it to the in order to one of these miner to bother process your transact it help to a small fee that to the miner differ from the transact fee of the system is that the network a fluid open market for these fee rather than have them set by the bank or credit card will end up pay the actual cost it take for a to process the transact and it on the in the near term these transact fee are by the mine reward but as product slow the transact fee are expect to reach an equilibrium approach the true cost of process a transact that to make transact simpler and more seamless for and merchant may fee on top of for their but the for to transact over the will act as a to keep these fee at a reason and rate the past level of ha never exist in the space and the market price ha not been down now that we know a about how will drive transact cost down take a look at the rel risk in the old platform not to entrust third with your person or inform in order to use credit card and theft are not a risk when use use cash the risk of run into counterfeit bill with on the other hand counterfeit is not which risk and cost and counterfeit are with so too are a transact is a credit card and cost for merchant while theft ha occur in the past all of these breach have exploit weak to the protocol itself \\t also import to note that the payment system been talk about while standard for most modern western are much less in part of the world \\t in fact transact between differ can be an complex and process in the space have the area of intern transact as an area where is most \\t right now if you want to send money from the us to say in have to not pay fee to but also pay amount the two are go to have differ bank system that actual connect to each other \\t on the other hand is unbound and can be access by in the world with an internet connect mean that the around the world can now transact in the global \\t one of the most use case of as an intern payment platform is the market a is when who work in one send money back to friend or in current put the global market at over billion dollar and these transfer are rife with fee and other that cut out amount of the money be sent interview on \\t nick develop at discuss what like work with merchant who want to accept and the for payment interview on \\t nick develop at discuss what like work with merchant who want to accept and the for payment interview on talk about the problem have transact in the develop world and how can revolut intern transact here to tell you some more about specif about how the protocol work i will the ha at least a basic understand of how money work and i will be smear out some detail to make thing easier to understand if you ever want to know more of the detail you can do research \\t is a digit most think of money transfer as take place physic like give bob a bill for some if ever sent money oversea you might have done a wire transfer which doesn\\'t you hand dollar bill instead you call your bank them you are who you say you are tell them how much to send where to send it and which account to take it out of so we shouldn\\'t be shock at the idea of digit or money been around for a while in the form of wire transfer \\t to understand a bit better first look at how the bank doe the wire transfer the bank ha a big ledger or spreadsheet with all of their person and account inform when call them and claim to be she give them enough inform about herself where she grew up a secret number and the name of her first love to them that she is call the bank want to be reason sure the request is then tell them she want to wire to account and the bank make sure that actual ha enough dollar in her account to pay bob along with all the bank fee and if she doe then they send the money so how bank do wire transfer \\t import in all and how much trust ha to place in the bank for to work the bank ha control over her money the bank ha a lot of her person inform the bank could lie to her about how much of her money is there and she wouldn\\'t find out a posit \\t send is actual similar to send a wire transfer except there is no bank instead of a bank use network digit and proof of work to accomplish the same task of transfer go to talk soon in more detail about each of these but first walk an \\t say want to send 1 to bob she doesn\\'t have to physic hand to bob the to wire money had to herself or prove she who she she had to say how much to send where to send it and where to take it from so a transact which is just a with the to from and amount list and digit sign it then she it to the network the internet and the network start about it you hear sent bob 1 did you hear sent bob 1 did you hear \\' after a few second the whole network ha heard about it \\t miner are part of the network so they hear about the transact and put it in a block with other transact then the miner start the proof of work and when they do enough work they the block to the network and transact to bob out the link for good visual repres to supplement the ) \\t talk about network \\t there are thousand of around the world call node that are connect to each other in call the network who ha a and an internet connect can a node each node is connect to or know about sever other node call their they are call no node is more than other which is the network is call a network instead of a network \\t node hear about transact and pass them around to their peer after a while ha heard about them the all the node to their share ledger the in the same way without trust node more than the other a map of all the node check out the in the supplement ) now talk about public key encrypt digit are a type of public key encrypt key encrypt might sound but the basic idea is the core thing to understand is the idea of a trapdoor function all about thing be difficult to rever to light a of paper on fire but difficult to reconstruct the paper from the ash so a trapdoor function is to but difficult to rever how do the trapdoor function work person ha two number call the public and key we call them key both of them can lock and unlock thing the public key is use to the trapdoor function public so can do it the key is use to rever the trapdoor function and you can do it how doe the digit work take a and encrypt or lock it with your key then you send it out to whoever and can or unlock the with your public key the reason call a digit is if to the they won\\'t be to encrypt it to make the digit they need your key to do that difficult to but to check can be read by but you can write them sort of like a handwritten but better use digit to that is spend money from their own account not you go to a foreign land and you hear about a great wonder of the world there you ask a man name where it is and he take you to a small build and say is the wonder you you wouldn\\'t right would an build be a wonder of the world so you keep look come across a woman name and ask her is great wonder that i have heard about \" and she take you to a pyramid is the wonder you seek \" she say is much more than right the pyramid took a lot of work to make it what make it a wonder is a similar idea except it work with number instead of build import fact about number is that most number are big you proof of work use trapdoor function like with digit but instead of make that is difficult to it use that is difficult to predict i put a number into trapdoor function and hash it as call and it output a differ number in an way if i hash number the output is differ from the output so now if i come to you with a big number that when you hash it come out as a small number that i search a lot of number to find it most of the big input hash to big output most number are big so that special input that come out small like a block in the pyramid of a lot of work you can\\'t just take a small number and run the hash backward a trapdoor function it doesn\\'t go backward so proof of work and from earlier both come to you with differ version of the and ha a bunch of big number that hash to big number where as ha a bunch of big number that hash to small number like the pyramid a lot more time and effort a lot more work small number are rare so her is the one that ha been work on go the with and bob one more time want to send 1 to bob she a say want to send 1 to the transact she encrypt or lock it with the key to her account make a digit then can unlock the digit with her public key to see that she is who she say she is but can it and it without her key digit sign it she it to the nearest node which then begin spread the news of the transact to all it peer who in turn spread it to their peer and so on until the whole network ha heard about it at some point a miner will hear about it and put it in a block which is basic a bag of transact text is the same as number to a so the miner then treat that block as a big number and start search for number to stick on the end of it so that the two number hash to a small number is the proof of work when a miner find that special number the next block is said to be mine and transfer to bob is \\t discuss the protocol explain the and talk about develop in mine the supplement for a breakdown of exist mine pool ) head of risk at discuss hi vision for and how work to for user video on talk about the for to use the protocol to build new big part of what make so is the vast array of that can happen with the now that learn how to understand at a high

recommend to the java as mention in the video so that it doe not problem afterward lot of option are avail to write your code text editor will work text editor like notepad are also good but no one use them more other than old school class we will more option to write code in java is all time for most of java video will you about and best for a wide of is avail but we recommend to use most basic one first program is expect to be and we don't want except here i will you to write your basic hello world program and run it via print hello world is not enough you need to understand the syntax and mean of each line written in java i will you with each line and it mean while write java hello world and run is a bit differ from other program it convert code into an stage rather then just convert into learn more about i e java virtual in are a dozen of thing that one need to take care while program will make your life easier while code few shortcut tip are also that will help you to fast code your snippet time in your you want to take input from the user in regular command line it is to do so but ha a special place where you can keep those test argument and use them again and again to give you code use the teach hope will help you to edit the exist code but i recommend to write code from keyboard instead of it it will help you to syntax as well you will gain program some to store differ will help you to understand differ avail to a java the name suggest mean that can in an part for and so is the case with java will help you to understand the syntax of java we are talk about the type of number avail in java although complex class for number is also avail but i want thing to go gradual first learn about the usual number and their in java program and latter we will learn from complex class of number \\t there are two type of in java convert smaller number to bigger hold type of number and convert bigger hold number to smaller hold number the second one is as it the risk to loo the origin are just true and will help you to understand the of these two in your code there are some in built to and these type which are explain in the \\t access like public and protect are use and are use a lot in java know more about them in detail manner via a number of access to set access level for class method and constructor the four access level time we need to assign a to a is known as assign and for these a few are assign learn more about these in lot of time we need to two in program to find the way of our code is known as program but the thing that the is like greater than less than or may be equal or may be less than or equal such are discuss in are a few logic that you might have your school like and or and not are use in program and will help you to understand the the logic in detail syntax of a while loop syntax of a do while loop \\t for loop is use when you know how time a task is to be repeat syntax of a for loop \\t statement \\t after java 5 the for loop is use for array \\t the syntax of for loop \\t : \\t { \\t \\t } keyword can be use in of the loop control it the loop to jump to the next of the loop can also be with argument in them the number of argument that you wish is depend on the there are of method ( ) dot dot by which you can pass n number of argument come with complex class for most the type the new complex class for number make number more power and new function in them is a walk through for complex class of number cannot edit a string you have save in complex class it would like like you have done wrong in the syntax and even will also not complain but intern you are use much more then you should be use use class to deal with problem at stage is a complex object in java in fact date is so much use that there are class for date one of the them is calendar although it ha calendar in it name but it is use for time and extend time display of such as and you one array such as number and use and to \\t the class extend and implement the list support array that can grow as need \\t standard java array are of a fix length after array are they cannot grow or shrink which mean that you must know in how element an array will hold \\t array list are with an size when size is exceed the collect is when object are the array may be shrunk deal up all these and other such except we will learn except in are thousand of class wait for you to use them but still when we design our we need to our own class will help you to understand about creation of custom class recommend to keep file in some kind and of default is will teach you new as well as exist file in with the help of \\t method in java can be static or can be is a to method from class are the method with same name and even if you don't constructor will one for you learn to overload a constructor and use and setter method in java mean function of class into the new class is done use extend keyword is a full walk through for the of such case from class have their own function if you want to call those method in sub class then you can use super keyword but java give you the to those class is known as method should have the to take input from the user there a lot of method by which you can take input from user small show to take input from user and also to stop the from take input from the user without make the cold or close work with data that can be save on disk we need to work with class that can read and write file on disk will help you to write data in file as well as read data from file are to built a small that can give us detail

end of the you will be train in as well as in all these and more are in hour of learn student with the skill to write basic for server pass the to server \\t understand is an acronym for system and is the most popular and wide use system in the world server is avail in 6 differ edit you can pick the one that match what you need as well as your budget of server server studio or in short is the most import tool in the product server studio also refer to as is the main tool of the server product how to use to the and what all you can do with it differ part of and take a look at some of the server that are avail are differ that are store within a file will see how you can and certain object use the tool the main point of lesson some of the object and in a known as is the main for talk to which is differ from server the product is a it is flavor of is call which is a short form for transact contain that are specif to server and obviou work with them with a in to see what it allow us to do you to some statement that allow to object like and in an server platform will see how we can differ object in server use the alter and drop command constraint what they are the differ type that are avail and they are use how to use differ constraint and the effect they have on data within the is an import command at some use of the select statement case is one that let you the way a in a column is display in the result how you can use the differ case for more scenario the select statement you store data in a under differ column each column is allow to be for a data type will see how you can work with string data type in server and store differ type of string data within them first of data type is the one that store exact these have further under them as well how you can work with data and store differ in a how we can use differ date and time type as well as the effect that the date format ha on the in understand date of the data type are meant for special and scenario at some of the data type avail in server how you can use the order by to sort result of a and some of it differ form that you can use to column to sort on in an order by by the column name with comma the sort will be perform in the order of the column given how to use the top offset and fetch for page record the where differ and to filter search result some way of filter data in select for differ type of result how to use string in as well as the and all how you can from at the same time and the way that server understand how server from one must first understand you use in the first place is a core concept of call how work when use at the differ type of join and the differ between each and each should be use with cross join is the simplest form of a join when you use a cross join in a select statement it is function to the case of the name of the in the from how use differ type of show differ result how you can use certain keyword how the join hint are use in \\t see how data can be ad to a use the insert command you will also see it variant that allow you to add data in differ way to the how to add record to a use the differ form of the insert statement third method of bulk ad data is help call an bulk insert is most use when the data is to the how you can use the select select into and bulk insert command to add record to a in one go the statement allow you to exist data in a how to record in a use the command and record to use it where how to data that is record from a in use the statement how record can be from a use the and statement an of server that let you data between two is done use a new statement call that the power of the insert and statement how we data between two use the statement along with the 2 rule about function what they are how they work and how you can use them also see the differ of function that exist and look at some of the most use function within those function are an import part of server by default you cannot mix data type within a statement logic function are use to perform logic in and time function are a import of function and are use quit while use to date the function here can also time as well how to use differ function from differ you'll see how to use them with a as well as with column in with row of data about group data the need to do so and an to special function call function or function or as known are special function in server these work over group of data rather on row other function some of group and use differ to see an overview of data to use in server program and the differ way and place you can use them in \\t see how to and use them in differ place and and use batch flow statement let you behavior a bit by give a differ direct to the statement how to use differ control flow statement like the if and while along with statement batch within a contain about store an program construct in that let you a batch of statement that can be you want you how to a store it and then it to use to make it even more use you may need to use them and the differ type of that are a look at write and see how they work how express can help write more complex differ window function like rank and den rank and the differ between them function refer to as are custom function you can for your own specif use how you can a custom user function and how it can be use pivot is basic a way to take raw data and perform some on it by follow some rule how we can use the pivot to data from a a normal group use a group by you might that you can group column at a time how group set can the way that you use group

your own game in put sprite on the screen make them move input by touch or and ad sound to your game while is aim at to i do play around with some kind of program at some point but even if play around with and some you\\'ll do fine focu on game develop in - start with no code and go on from there design to take place over a but here on to it at your own pace you can get the basic under your belt and at the end of you\\'ll be to put game use you\\'ll just sharpen your brain and head into the first lesson of the the basic of use the how to object and keyboard interact audio sound effect and music use the system and more the scene in the origin video then go far beyond we need a set of graphic for our game follow video to see how to download and import them into our project add a to the and how to prefab or game object we\\'ll an and play around with what we have then see how to save the scene so we can come back and work on it later some code is go to be to a game use so take a look at about which drawn toward or can them both and a quick video explain either is just fine your toe into the world of script for script are way to refer a game object in a script but one of the easiest is avail if we the object we\\'ll how to do that in video as well as play around with the keyword in the next set of video we need a specif scene build an actual ) so we\\'ll that in video an at scene build and don\\'t need to walk through the process again just skip to the last of the video to see what it should look like but i the video if a stuff is still not at point don\\'t it will much easier for you as you keep we\\'ll a script that will be ad to our bomb prefab been miss a way for the player to interact with the scene so fix that now build a new script that show how to fire off some code when you click on a game object with your in the scene again our old friend pay a visit is one of those word that strike fear into the heart of and new game develop but you can think of it as clone a new of a prefab in your code the game clone it with want monster to drift onto the screen head for the heroin drop her sword those monster forewarn there are a concept that i gloss over in lesson such as and the good news is that even with the you\\'ll end up with enough to be clone by midnight tonight that we can i want to all the time so the secret formula for your game object ha a on it a way to get the thing move apart from the physic that we play with earlier method allow you to the object direct you want by ad a to the x or y of the object to dash off a script that work for your current game but smarter is to and think of way to write script that can be use over and over again in differ game what we\\'ll attempt here game the player to move object or sprite on the screen a in a game a spaceship the or a plumber in a game so how to movement is also while there are some more concept in the script we\\'ll be write the code itself is 5 line long my kind of script far dealt with sprite but a cool way to use sprite sheet intern refer to that happen the sprite itself such as a bid with flap wing the wing are a part of the sprite itself then you\\'d use or similar to make the flap bird move across the screen look at sprite sheet is a look a lot more to sprite sheet that we won\\'t get into right now system just are cool they allow you to visual effect without the need for actual artwork much artwork you can billow smoke magic etc use they are the kind of thing that can add polish to your game the first video below as an to touch on what it take to a from scratch go to show you the basic of make a but then switch over and show you how you can use \\t our scene have been so far but quiet fix that by ad some background music and some sound effect when the coin are pick up by the beach ball \\t you\\'ll need to download a zip file with three file in it we\\'ll be use those in section you can find the download link in the section to the right avail on \\t the are in the public domain and the music use is 0 from a guy name carter a link to the page for the song gel game have music play as the pick up coin or find your way through the maze video show how you can add background music to your game add a sound effect when the player pick up a coin those touch can add a lot to your game \\t week is all about the user but such a huge subject go to be look at a part text element and button \\t you\\'ll use text for show the score display the of the game let the player know when won or lost etc \\t in our game week we\\'ll be use one button but that button will be do job make game object vanish script and play music \\t the first part of lesson don\\'t need special just a new scene in project but the second part need a special project so you\\'ll need to download it over on the right not avail on not new to game develop new to quick video show how to fix the i whine about in the video you don\\'t have a true type font lay around to use in lesson check the to the right for a link to a site that ha free font you can download a button to our game see how it is to hook the button up to of our project what we learn in the last section put the text and button element to use in a game if you didn\\'t download the project in the last section did download it but mess it go grab it now won\\'t be a game but it come close and stop you from take what you now know and ad to it \\t the basic of shoot a at the use the at the right to grab the code in video a button to and a game object add some score to the game document in

on the screen a random ball is at the of the tap the ball should fall and around the screen you will need to setup a base physic that loop around the border of the screen you can use the frame when your physic you should have differ type of ball at random each time there is a tap each with their own physic that make them differ from one there are graphic for 3 differ type of an 8 ball - should be the heaviest and not as much as the other a soccer ball - a bit lighter than the 8 ball and more a beach ball - ball should be light and setup the basic 3 ball with sprite physic by differ physic are some suggest for thing to make one of the ball make one of the ball spin when it is see what happen when you turn off the friction for all the ball see what happen when you set the friction to

node to display how much ammo is avail and an action to increment the ammo each \\t the ammo setter allow us to our limit and the ammo display at the same \\t in our shoot method we limit our shot and the ammo with a if the video where we ad shot limit i talk about the idea that we could instead limit our shot by allow a of cannon ball on screen at one time see if you can work out how to implement behavior and make it so that 2 cannon ball can be on screen at the same time are a of way we could our shot limit one way would be to take of our exist ammo but set maximum to 2 we would then need to our action that our ammo over time and instead the ammo each time a cannon ball is from our scene happen in two when a ball with a halo and when a ball move of the screen second way that we could the would be to check how cannon ball node are in the scene when we to shoot if there are 2 or more then we don\\'t allow the player to shoot we could set up in the shoot \\t let give the player a first line of by ad a row of shield their cannon when a halo hit a shield it should destroy both the shield and he halo a new for our our method we add some code to setup 6 shield the the of our halo to the new shield we respond to a contact between a halo and shield in the ad quit a bit of code to our shield in video we review all code in closer detail if you feel got a good understand on how it all work then you may want to skip video \\t in video we\\'ll a game over by ad a bar the cannon that if hit by a halo trigger the end of the game \\t first we need a new for the life \\t we the life bar node in the \\t we the of the halo to the new life bar \\t we our method to take the name of the we wish to \\t we can then our to respond to the bar if you can a new type of mini that occur time a cannon ball off the side of the screen you will need to setup a new effect file and detect when there is a between a cannon ball and an in term of posit your check out the that is part of the object in the method to help get your right next to the video we run through how we can the to display an effect each time a cannon ball off the of the screen first need to a new effect file with the effect you want for the cannon ball need to detect when there is contact between a ball node and an we set up by set the of our physic can then add a new if statement in the method to respond to the contact between ball and we can use the of the contact object pass into the method to posit our \\t we our shield and life bar setup code move it from the method into a a method that we call when we detect a between a halo and the life bar method all the halo on screen and all the other node we make it wait for 1 5 second trigger a new \\t so that we can through all the halo node we need to make sure we give them a is a review video of the code we wrote to setup our game reset function if you feel got a good of the code then feel free to skip video as not go to cover new \\t we setup a new label to display the current score on \\t we a new in the header \\t we the setter method of to the \\t when we detect a between a halo and a ball we the also reset the score when in the method \\t have good art is obviou a big part of game but not all of us are artist there are a number of web where you can find art design specif for game can be use for find art to use in your game even if you just need to test out game concept with and use as art get art design specif for your game you use art from the web make sure you \\t we are about to add some sound to our space cannon game and so found a of sound on org that have some sound we can use \\t * for when our cannon shoot we need to edit sound to the echo \\t * for when a halo off an \\t * for when a ball off an we need to edit sound to the echo \\t there is also a great sound in the \\t these are the origin of the specif sound we are use from the sound \\t is free open for record and edit sound in video we see how we can use an audio edit program like to edit sound to get them for our game \\t core format is the audio format by the so good if we can convert our sound file into format prior to ad them to our game import to understand that the file format is just a wrapper for the actual audio data and so we have a lot of as to how we want the data in the file in term of perform best if we use an data format such as linear when we our file we need to keep in mind that our file size will be larger when use an format to when we are use compress if file size is a concern then may be worth as it give compress on audio file \\t to convert a file to use an data format open a window to the folder where the file is store and then \\t caff \\t to do the same use \\t caff \\t to save time in the we can a shell script to take care of the for us a file with the follow code and name it sh \\t for f in * do \\t caff \\t done \\t if we put that file in a with the file we want to convert we can run the script to convert all the file by type into the \\t sh sh video we use the action to add sound effect to our game it is a good idea if we our sound base action prior to start a game so that we don\\'t get in our when play a sound for the first time to hold our action to play our our action in the method our sound are load prior to start the \\t setup sound run our action we want to play a sound e also tell our ball and halo physic to the as part of their can then play a sound when a halo or ball off an a new class to our menu class inherit from we the method in class to add the aspect of our in our scene we import the header file for our menu a to hold an of our setup our menu in the \\t setup menu our menu class we give the node for the play button a our scene we a state to make it to tell if we are in a game or set to no and hide our menu when we start a new game in the then do the in our also need to check if we are in a game when we go to shoot our we add a touch end event to detect a tap of the play video is a quick review of the method and the code we wrote to check if our touch event within the play button for our menu video we fix up a of to do with our score label we see that we hadn\\'t yet set the text of our label when we load our game then when we do set the text our game slow down while it the display of the text we can fix up by set the text in our method we also hide our score label when not current in a game move the call to set our score into the method of our scene so that the text will be set when the game load we also set the ammo to 5 so that it doesn\\'t build up while on the menu and we hide the score label when the game is in the also need to set the hidden to ye in the method and to no in the method our menu class we add 2 label node to display the current and best score on the menu we set these up in the the header of our menu class we 2 to maintain the score to be then the setter on these to the our scene class we need to tell the menu what score to display we do when we a game video we review the code we wrote to display our score as part of our menu we don\\'t cover new so feel free to skip video if you feel with we did when set up need a way to save our best score between session of our app we can use the class for in video we\\'ll have a bit of a discuss about class what it doe and how we can use it to make sure our score are save to disk need to persist the player high score between session of the app in video we see how we can use to save and load the top score a we can use to access the a to use as a key for the data we want to the method we the with the save in do a save when we get a new high score we call to make sure the data is video we fix up a few bug we have in our game prevent halo from off the top of our if they spawn too close we make the higher by ad a bit of a also prevent halo from destroy more than one shield by set their when a contact i don\\'t show it in video that same line of code should be ad within all the contact test with a halo our method we clean up halo that drop below the bottom of the video we see how we use the speed of an action to how fast it run we set the speed of our action that spawn our halo so that the game get harder the longer the player we run an action on a node we can give it a key so that we can access it again have a speed we can use to speed up or slow down our action in our case we want to the speed that halo are spawn each time we spawn a halo we add code to the in the new game method we reset the speed of our video we setup a new sprite kit file to be use to a trail of flow out from behind our ball node video we see how we can use the to direct that spawn from an to move into the space of allow us to move an node without all the follow it our and add it as a child of the ball we direct the to set it to move around in the system of the main layer trail have a problem with our trail node in that all the disappear when parent node is from the scene in video we look at one for by a new class for our ball node that ha a refer to a trail node we can then add the trail node as a child of the main layer rather than the ball and the posit of the node as the ball move we can also turn off the trail and it when our cannon ball is a new ball class in the header we a and a implement the method and we the method so that we can turn off the trail when the ball is in our scene we the of our cannon ball in the shoot method to use our new can then move the node to be a child of the main layer and set a refer to the on the our method when we through all the ball node we can call the method on each of them to make the follow the video we review some of the code been write over the last few space cannon video we take a closer look at the speed of action and run through in more detail what we need to do to set up the trail effect for our cannon ball video we a limit to our ball take of the fact that we now have a class for them the ball ha 3 time we it next time it hit an a new in the header of the ball when we detect a contact between a ball and an we can increment the and the ball if too video we setup a differ type of halo we give a halo a 1 in 6 of use a differ graphic that an in the number of point we get per halo we spawn a halo we set 1 in 6 halo to be a point halo we take of the of the halo node to mark particular node as a can then check if the halo is a halo when we detect a between a ball and a add a bit more interest to the game with the of a point if the player to destroy a halo their point by 1 and the will score more point for each halo they destroy without miss if the player miss their point will be reset to 1 a new in the header of our then a label node to display the current point setup label in the the setter of our to the display label when the we destroy a halo we the by the of also increment if we destroy a reset it when a ball too time or the is to a bomb power up power up should be a new type of halo with a differ graphic the bomb halo should show up there are current 4 halo on screen and a halo is about to halo should be a bomb halo if the player to shoot the bomb then all the halo that are current on screen should also blow up player doesn\\'t score for the extra if the bomb to get down and hit one of the shield then all of the shield should be video we our for a bomb power up our power up is a new type of halo our code for one is go to be in the method our rule for a bomb power up is that there ha to be 4 halo current on screen we need to get a count of how halo are on screen we our halo when they are not on the screen we can just loop through all the children of the main layer and count up those that have the name can then check if our count is 4 in which case we can set a few halo on the the halo just to turn it into a bomb halo we the and set the to a ye for the key note that we can check for a count of 4 here we haven\\'t yet ad our new halo to the main layer that code happen after so when we did our count we got back the number of exist halo not the one we are in we destroy a halo with a cannon ball we need to check the of the halo to see if it ha the ye assign to the key for bomb we do in the method if we just destroy a bomb then we go ahead and all the exist halo node ad an each time we first set the name of the halo that the detect to trigger to nil so that we don\\'t add an extra for in our method time where we detect a between a halo and a shield we again check for a of ye for our key bomb in the time when we a bomb we instead all the shield by loop through them and call video we our for a bomb power up our power up is a new type of halo our code for one is go to be in the method our rule for a bomb power up is that there ha to be 4 halo current on screen we need to get a count of how halo are on screen we our halo when they are not on the screen we can just loop through all the children of the main layer and count up those that have the name can then check if our count is 4 in which case we can set a few halo on the the halo just to turn it into a bomb halo we the and set the to a ye for the key note that we can check for a count of 4 here we haven\\'t yet ad our new halo to the main layer that code happen after so when we did our count we got back the number of exist halo not the one we are in we destroy a halo with a cannon ball we need to check the of the halo to see if it ha the ye assign to the key for bomb we do in the method if we just destroy a bomb then we go ahead and all the exist halo node ad an each time we first set the name of the halo that the detect to trigger to nil so that we don\\'t add an extra for in our method time where we detect a between a halo and a shield we again check for a of ye for our key bomb in the time when we a bomb we instead all the shield by loop through them and call video we touch on the concept of pool we can perform of our game by the object go to need throughout a game prior to start it we are then less like to slowdown if we have to a number of object at as we can pull exist object out of a pool and use them our scene class we a new to hold our then move the of our from our method into the method and add them to the pool rather than the scene our method we can push all the shield into the main layer make sure we them from the we a shield node from it parent we need to push it back into the video we add a new power up to the game the idea is that if the player can shoot a shield that float across the screen they get one of their miss shield return a new method to spawn the shield power up we use the on the physic to make it spin we need to a new for our shield power then an action in the method to period spawn shield power video we get the shield power up work so that we can have our shield return to us in the of a game first need to tell sprite kit that we want to know about contact between a ball node and a shield power up we can react to those contact in the a new action to play a sound when we collect a power in the also make sure we shield power up that to get to the other side of the screen we do in the time is to a new type of power up that will put the cannon into a shot mode when in mode time the player fire the cannon will shoot 5 cannon ball 1 after the other with a delay of 0 1 second between each shot the cannon will also to green when in mode the player will stay in mode until they run out of ammo and so mean that their ammo should not while in mode it also mean their ammo should be reset to a full 5 ammo when they first enter the shot mode the power up itself will use a small of a green cannon and will float from the left hand side of the screen to the right at the same speed as the shield power up a new power up should be spawn for halo that the player destroy shot power up is not a super one to there are a number of we need to make throughout the code to get setup in video we look at what we need to do to our need to have a way to count how halo have been destroy so we a new at the top of our game scene to act as a in our method in the if statement where we detect a contact between a ball and a halo we can the counter we can make use of the to check if the halo just hit is a of in which case we\\'ll call a new method we can setup a new power up go to need a for it physic we can up with our other constant in our game a new method to spawn a shot power up the method a new sprite node and assign it a posit to the left side of the screen but with a random posit we setup the physic of the node so that it will float across the screen from left to right and we also give it a need to the of our cannon ball so that we are of a between a ball and our new type of power do a bit of clean up and in our method by power up node that to make it across the screen without be also power up that are on the screen in our that set up our power up we can start implement it function we a new in the header file of our game class to when our cannon should shoot shot at a the setter of our in the game implement file so that we can set the of our cannon base on the of the when in mode the cannon should be our method we add a new check for a between a ball and a shot power up when occur we the 2 node set to ye play a power up sound and set our ammo to want to allow the player 5 shot in mode go back to normal mean we need to stop our ammo from over time we can set up in our method where we are the action that increment our ammo we can wrap our increment statement in an if statement that check that not in we do our shot it would be if we can just call shoot for each one of the 5 shot our shoot method current contain code to check the ammo and it we code and move it to the point where actual call our method we our call to shoot by first check that we have ammo we also do a check to see if in mode if we are then we shoot 4 time each one delay by 0 1 second from the last if run out of ammo we turn mode off and set the ammo back to need to make sure that not in mode at the start of a game so in our new game method we turn mode off we also reset our counter that count the number of halo shot power up is not a super one to there are a number of we need to make throughout the code to get setup in video we look at what we need to do to our need to have a

we implement these method in the implement file for the \\t we also set self to ye in the \\t in the scene class instead of set menu hidden when we start a new game we call the hide \\t then in our game over method we call the show method after a slight \\t final when we are check for a touch end on the menu we first check if the menu is \\t in video we use a group action to run 2 action when as part of the menu we also set the time mode on our action to give it an effect \\t in the show method of our menu class we add some action to the node make it fade in and drop down from at the same \\t * document on and group \\t * to add more to our menu class the show method of our menu class we add action group to a zoom out and fade in effect on our score our method we need to our score label so they are children of the score board and their posit \\t we finish off the of our menu by fade in the play button and delay set the on our menu we also add a zoom into the effect on our whole menu when we hide it \\t in the show method of our menu class we add a fade in effect to our play button and set the the fade ha \\t in the hide method of our menu class we zoom the menu node use a action

in the method of the \\t set them to hidden by \\t we also set our button to be when we start a new game and hid it when we have a game over \\t * \\t * \\t node have a call which when set to ye will sprite kit to skip over them when run action and move them around we can use to implement the function of our game \\t we and implement a new to the state of our game it will show and hide our and button we the game by set the on our \\t in the method we that we can\\'t shoot when the game is by ad an extra check to the if \\t then in our method we add an extra case to our exist if to touch on our and would be nice for the user if the game if they press the home button to quit the game or if they an interrupt like a or a phone call we can set up by set the on our scene in the method of our our class we need to perform a of can then set the of our scene to ye when we a \\t in video we see how we can use an to play loop music \\t we first need to import in our scene \\t we can then an \\t in the method we load the music and get it play we set the to so that it will loop \\t asset \\t * \\t link \\t * the music we are is to add a new button to the menu that turn the music on and off the button should appear to the right of the play button two graphic are for the one button that will it look base on whether or not the music is play when the music is play the button should use the and when not it should use the play the music button should fade in like the play button doe when the menu is brought up after a game video we look at how to add a a new button to our menu that turn the music on and off start by set up the button in our menu class in the implement file we an that is an to as the can then set our to an and posit our button in the need a way to the of our button so we a in the header file of our menu then the setter method of our in the implement file for our menu class so that it the of our button base on the of the want to make our button fade in with the other menu item when the menu is display we can do by run the same action that we run on the play button in the show method of our menu that our new button is all set up on our menu we can start and stop the music when touch we do by ad a new test in the event of our scene if the node we touch is the music button then we flip the state of the on our menu class and then tell the audio player to either start or stop base on the state of the need to make sure that the of our menu is in sync with the state of the audio player at the start of the game so we set it to ye in the method of our video we look at how to add a a new button to our menu that turn the music on and off start by set up the button in our menu class in the implement file we an that is an to as the can then set our to an and posit our button in the need a way to the of our button so we a in the header file of our menu then the setter method of our in the implement file for our menu class so that it the of our button base on the of the want to make our button fade in with the other menu item when the menu is display we can do by run the same action that we run on the play button in the show method of our menu that our new button is all set up on our menu we can start and stop the music when touch we do by ad a new test in the event of our scene if the node we touch is the music button then we flip the state of the on our menu class and then tell the audio player to either start or stop base on the state of the need to make sure that the of our menu is in sync with the state of the audio player at the start of the game so we set it to ye in the method of our video look at a great that make it to icon file at all the differ size we need for our app and game if you don\\'t have then you may want to skip video on your first major game next we will begin game are go to be make a brick breaker style game in video we do our standard setup task to get our project our game is go to be in portrait orient so we the option we also turn off the bar by the method in the view control to return ye we then clear the code we don\\'t need from the scene class and add the we\\'ll be use to the project for asset video we add the to our game and make it so that when we drag our touch on the screen the move from side to side start by an for the and a to hold the touch in our the method we setup the we begin a touch event we store the of the touch in our can then find out how far our touch ha move in the event and the posit of the need to stop the player from move the all the way the screen we can do by put a limit on how far the can move the event we set the posit of the if move too video we setup a method to a ball in our scene start by a method to spawn a ball the method expect the posit and of the ball to be pass the method for our scene we turn off the and call our method to spawn a ball we also add an around the border of our scene so that the ball will around the screen an is a static are never move by the and their mass matter are use to neg space within a scene as a hollow spot or an thin for are frequent use to the of your scene the main differ between a and a is that an permit movement it own while a is a solid object if are move through other mean they interact with not with other the friction the rough of the it is use to the friction that a to other move along it the and are use

enjoy the begin wish \\t like other kind of the to and share idea with other and to sit down and talk with custom and get their feedback and understand their need see what the program is all about \\t not good old old good \" \\t quot \\t he might have written for c who know \\t if you talk to a man in a he understand that to hi head if you talk to him in hi that to hi heart have a look at build block of c unit explain basic of standard c program which is for write first c program c statement will come under either of the 4 of of c program viz type statement statement instruct and control of the except control ha been cover in detail use and that student doe not know about of program is given on of operand and instruct unit is by focu on two of the frequent use function in c i e and in c the problem then write the code \\t here is a video that explain how to open base open file write program and how to save the program further two program have been been taken in video and each step ha been explain with what happen at the background ha been shown use which will boost your you write program on your own the princess of program good do program not they expect to get paid or get by the public but it is fun to program \\t is the new topic insert for those who want to write and program in base my design are work round the clock to content of chapter and are commit to finish remain topic in chapter as as complex is the of program is the most popular program in the world i e program you would learn about comment and header file are good at follow instruct but not at read your mind \\t in the second part i am cover basic of main function in c like return type of main function argument taken by main function and comparison of with do base editor not good at with not good at \\t the part 3 cover a few command code is written use video explain you and of c program use command is it just take a to understand it \\t here is program to convert in to is second part of an interest program listen care is an interest code for you to is of chapter what you have so far \\t a good is base on and not on number \\t is part of life so how could be c is away from of while write program \\t here the of first section is follow by need of control in c with a few real life you learn such control in c you need to know is it and in which you can learn first control in c i e if control and watch care what is the syntax by and how it can be use while write a c program section also cover a one more like in c is second control i e if control in c apart from syntax i am focu on design aspect of program i e import of flowchart with syntax the flow of control ha been explain use and a with real life c program also ha been explain with step by step is not but need to be taken to at the the video give you interest real life for of the nest of if block more life complex know to the happen with c program and logic would help you to convert complex program over all there are 3 logic in c viz logic and logic or and logic not \\t when work on c he want it to be compact such are there in c which hi is one of the best to make the code compact \\t same is explain here with enjoy learn c will be hard to in our life make us perfect program if we want certain part of the code to be then ha the in the form of loop control is to control in c i e loop control in c learn type of loop in c it time to have a look at common part of loop part of loop are to understand the word is from the loop know what i mean don\\'t you syntax is explain with real life and real life follow by program you can and play while write program interest know said that there is no formula for success or even to popular is second type of loop control in c and it is for loop in c though all loop same and the need of a for loop is use while write program in the name is the type of loop in c which is version of the first loop i e while loop use loop while implement data in c \\t are smell \\t listen should not be restrict to childhood \\t so here is wonder follow by of nest of loop in c the speed of life we need to break at the same time we forget the past and move on i mean isn\\'t that the way we live life is syntax and use of 2 statement in c incid keyword wonder explain use \\t special dish is version of basic dish to suit food lover and demand so is the case of loop in c so special loop neither a keyword nor a loop but is a version of while or do while loop in c but use in are make rule for and find to withdraw cash at the get into the car open your laptop or unlock your smart phone you will see menu the world is and option are be it gadget or about that and so made a of one more control in c for menu driven program here is switch case control in c in most interest way is for good enough for oh start with c am like an menu you can look but you can\\'t afford are build block of c it time to learn now to break code into small and small of code task are call as function in c that is the reason c is call as as well as modular which is base on orient program in have a look at to function in c first 4 section we were write code function i e main function we were call a few function like and here we will have a look at type i e of function in c from the day one after take up you have been write int main or void main what doe mean the same is explain here with interest real life enjoy and understand function are import part of c program as a one need not know these concept but understand and use them here is of the same in interest way a c life without pointer is life without food student to learn and power of pointer here is \\t pointer can be made to work if you with them long enough if you with long enough you will mess it program is like a you cannot write a poem without write it yet talk about program as if it were a product process and term of of line of code in so do they book that number on the wrong side of the we should refer number of line of code \\t here is one program to explain how we can write a function to perform 4 task the aim of the program is how to access in other function and make in them life is like program i guess if you love you can put into it \\t here is a recap of all topic we cover so far like data type in c control avail in c function in c and to pointer in last chapter now i my style and cloth from one day to the next but high school i blend in i think a lot of are that way i guess i can write about an array of is to an array video explain you how actual an array work i e how an array element are store in how control can be use to access an array element how an index of an array is use for access an array element etc interact with pointer took place in the last chapter but it just real power of pointer is when you start learn array string and file here is our to pointer video cover which could be perform and which are invalid some of them have got context of array or array rule is import while perform these on pointer these though seem to be to understand are of use when we the string object in c and is more import in than in is so is the against complex \\t pointer play a crucial role in array it is the pointer which help to access element of an array \\t here care how it work in c \\t is an of function chapter and is cover in array chapter find here how an array element and whole array can be sent to the function the key here is the term so my dear student don\\'t forget that you do there must be some kind of bound check be it love passion habit or in world of array in c doe not follow bound check learn here what i mean \\t video explain intern of an array and how it work import to understand the next topic of a few is an array should be spare \\t video explain to concept of array in c play crucial role in access element of array video explain you intern work of two dimens array i that a few i have to to explain you but are for understand program progress by line of code is like aircraft build progress by weight \\t here is quick review of the topic so far much more interest concept will be cover in the next topic i e string in c the last chapter we an array a data type we did not an array of in the last chapter of it peculiar here is is the video to the string i am in the process of for it take time and effort so i will be upload a few content keep do base old as said if your are use latest or there would not be much differ in the code plea cooper till i and them with base or base thank is the way to take the string input from the keyboard and print it on the screen play crucial role in array here is it how is the second part of string input and output i e function avail in c is the import of on string in c function help you to find number of in a string just check it out is the function to two string is the function of string function are the case function avail in the the string can be done by use the function here it is is the function to two string is a code of user function you can compact way of one string to string is the program to convert string to string we are not call function but have written own function can think about algorithm and to write differ code code is one more user function to count number of in a string the user function to two string use pointer or or',\n",

statement do great you do not have to be an expert to take \\t we offer you a free develop store so you can and learn first hand through these click \\t you'll need some of code for your train merchant is an and person web server that run give store design and develop the mean to run and test their work on their window desktop user and develop to the same on a local window as would be avail on a web server under merchant merchant an excel develop for develop to build test and run interact web deploy on a product merchant web server import that we understand how store morph work by know the and proper of the system it will be much easier to complex problem in the you can learn how to custom a merchant store it is that you learn the and the basic of merchant so you have a solid to build upon contain a lot of concept that are import to understand and comprehend dive head first into custom a merchant store the concept and in will give you the background you need to understand how merchant are and the differ element they contain that give merchant design in you will learn to and master the merchant \\t use the admin to about your store learn how to use the power custom option to the perfect store for your \\t one of the most import concept for master the merchant is understand how to and output for the page in we will teach you how to do that for code are two type of you can use in merchant a global and a local in we will talk about differ between the two code are that can be use throughout a merchant page to display a on the screen depend on which item you have assign to a page you have access to differ that you can use to write a to the screen code can contain differ type of data from to text string to when output an to the screen you have differ method to from code in is a collect of data element group under one name a can contain or a in we will dive deep into the and of merchant ha a scope it is either a local which is access use or a global access use the of a local start with l follow by the item be follow by the specif you are access in we'll walk you through these set static content is an part of but what happen when we want to do more what if we want to present specif data to a custom base on a they made or action they took to do we need to be to use statement to let the browser know what content to display code are a few group of that i will walk you through today some of the i will walk you through are logic comparison string and math code we talk about a loop doe is take in data from an array then some code for each item in the array code familiar with while loop in other program similar within merchant in take a look at how merchant while loop code that you have a background on loop with there is one more import concept that will give you a lot more control when work with it is call code familiar with work with array in other program then array in will feel familiar a major differ is that array in are 1 index instead of 0 take a look code go to talk about how to use the function that are part of merchant store code the last video i you with how to work with file system with the we were to check and see if the file exist it if it did and a new file with some data in video go to take it one step further code great part of use assign and in the is you get full access to all the file read write function that are part of merchant access to these function turn merchant into a power program talk more about that in code of these function must be call with two argument here design and is the number of second the begin of c u t at 1 can be obtain from the system and is set when the script start is at the moment that it is which one you use depend on what your program go through the detail \\t for code far work with two local and global in talk about a third call system code go to talk about hint at in a few video is a merchant tool which will show you all the that are on each page walk you through them can be one of the hardest concept in merchant to grasp they are import to how merchant page function an item is a user that specif function to a page all page have item assign to them some of use item would be the bar the tree and the head tag each of these are built in item that are assign to almost all page of the store go though them i want to talk about the differ between local item and global item that are assign to a page in merchant are the to power and in i will talk about how page and item go hand in hand just been to page take a deeper dive into some of the and function of page and how they work are page in merchant that have page with them in the merchant admin an of would be the page it is use to the checkout process it doe not have it own page instead the page ha logic built in that will direct you to either the page inform if you are log in or the page if you are not log in function is all built into the pseudo page go to talk about product list item a product list item is a power part of merchant it control the layout of product list take a look nice new to merchant 9 is the to custom all error on the site in take at look at how to custom the that your custom see field are not just limit to product you can also use them for or custom too learn to custom field can the of your store in walk you through an overview of the custom field option understand custom field and how they work import to understand how custom field have over the year in walk you through from where they began to where they are now code all the problem of exist custom field function in an to the custom field to extend function most critic to the to use custom field from page both read and write in show you how revolut your to custom your store dive into the new custom field syntax there are 8 for read 8 for write and then a debug function to help troubleshoot get start code basket field in merchant are a power develop tool they allow you to save data data you want with the shopper or the basket in walk you through the benefit of tool code merchant custom order field are similar to custom basket field instead of save data from a basket it save data from an order in i will walk you through the process and of power and tool code great about merchant custom field is that import and export through the merchant system in walk you through how to import and export your custom field to a file and even custom it to your need nice about merchant custom field is that they a debug function function can be use time you are have problem read or write a custom field code common thing do as a web develop work with merchant is work with both in the which would be an git or a form post where you have a form that submit to a page and pass input either hidden input or other input within the form the great part about is that it make it see how are a core part of the web and use in almost web site you visit a is just a small of data store local by a browser about a web site in talk about how work within the merchant code \\t one common area of when learn merchant and learn how to develop store in merchant ha to do with merchant default learn more about we now know that all pass in the global if you take a look at default that a of that are usual there dive into a few of them see them over and over again are what tell merchant what to do we touch on action in the last an action is an or a hidden input in learn more about action i want to dive in to merchant file specif the of the file and folder on the server get start page use the base tag which is a standard tag use to reset the base when use rel path for and more in learn more about page and how they to your store code a develop one thing that need to do quit a bit is stage your they go live you a code say to add new code and content when you hit the are reflect on the web site happen in real time so in a case where you want to make a lot of and preview it it live need to stage it in show you how code nice of merchant is the to turn on mode mode is a set the merchant admin mean no one can do with your store while in mode do major to the site say redo the look and feel of it is a perfect of when want to turn mode on will show you how to do that i will talk about are an import part of the merchant echo system you may have heard the term plugin app or add on a is all of those thing for merchant explain how to a there are a to process which go to go over are a develop tool that allow you to take a snapshot of the look and feel and save it into a file or that can be move and from one

hello world you will learn to your first with watch kit on learn to work with label and group make a share some tip to help your code if you have question plea upload your code see what will we got at the end of we have to make a design first you make app first of all you will come from your idea after that you should draw out your idea draw out how your app look like how and how button how that we will have a over view about our app and we can make an app you can that when we make a app like we are build a we build a we have to make a design for our and you know you can the time of make app from 2 or 3 time if you do so let start make our design first of all we will make an part for our and start with make a new project and make for part \\t as you can see we have a bug when we run our on a differ screen size doe not show up as we design so in i will help you use the auto layout to fix bug use auto layout you can see we have a bug when we run our on a differ screen size doe not show up as we design so in i will help you use the auto layout to fix bug use auto layout time for us to connect all the element on the to our for control it of all we have to which element on the we will we have to connect that element to our code for control \\t a start function for start count time for our stopwatch - to make a watch in our app use a timer to the time \\t timer = self nil when we have a of timer we need a function to format the to the format which we string { a = = = date = we will make a stop function for our watch when user press stop we want to stop the timer and reset the fix the bug when we press stop button we start the timer fix bug when we press the play button again when our stopwatch is run we will make a function for our watch when user press we want to stop the timer save the when user press play we will a new timer and shift the timer to the when user press play similar like a play button we will fix the bug when user press the button two time or user press the button we press play \\t - set up a when the user press the lap we will got the lap and show up to the our lap \\t - setup a clear function for user clear the set up a when the user press the lap we will got the lap and show up to the our lap setup a clear function for user clear the you can see function of our app is good now but we need to decor our for better user could you do that add a to app one time but we will do it again that you don't how to do that \\t - we will add a target to our \\t - similar like part we will make a for our watch app like our design \\t - to work with group on in we don't have auto layout function so we have to all the element by group and side with on the doe not support add a video or to our watch yet so we have to use a of to a to our app do that similar like we did on part time for us to hook all the element to out code for control when we add a new to our app the will help us a with swift for control the element in the doe not support the so we have to the by sever now we will make a connect between and app use function \\t - in the use to send a request to = and after that we will the from { : ) void in \\t if error nil { \\t \\t } \\t in use a will the request depend on the \\t : : ) ) { \\t if let = as { \\t if let = { \\t if { \\t \\t } \\t } \\t } \\t } will finish to send the request for all of our button on the we will send a differ request info depend on which button is press can send a request to part and a from part but that is from we want to the data and want to send back data to for we want to send the lap or the lap to our how can we do that we will make a swift file to save the info and and we will use a to send the info to app for run a function for us you can think it like now we will a new swift file that can save the the request and the to our watch { \\t let = \\t var : ) void \\t var \\t : : ) { \\t if let = as : { \\t = \\t } { \\t no \\t } \\t = \\t } that we will a object and use a to send it to our = \\t now we can on on add a stopwatch and fix when user press twice time when run stopwatch similar like part we will add new to check the stopwatch is run or not use a : to your function use a delay function to delay code and make a we will have a bug of function will run after we press more than two time in button to ask a question and fix our bug make a function for lap clear and get the lap button by send a request to part is a for you to my a develop of and is my third on is help you to make your own for watch as you know ha about watch from last year and they said that watch will be sale in at of the beta with watch kit for develop all around the world to make their and for of watch first of all if you don't know what watch is and how is is i think is the web site you should take a look you will use beta for code basic about code your time\",\n",

more i will point out some aspect of block in that you need to know to use their full in your along the way you will one of the common trick use in on rail and understand it work video you will learn

design pattern and best by the end of the you should be to understand and of the seen on popular and extend that to make app of your own student learn by build we have you build app the with the final app be a full date a tinder clone must say that so far is have the assign discuss and feedback from the instructor ha been the miss that i have been look for i have read a hand of book watch hour of video & type in a bunch of and final have to work through tough assign and what i have been learn it is all start to click - final \" discuss board is one of the best for a begin develop so much help be just the which i thought a great intro to the i feel been well worth the invest move week 2 is so differ than week 1 and i like it for the an excel for who want to make their first app it enough how is help me with my skill i think use protocol and is final second finger cross am love the class i have taken class at code school & and both were miss a key element the to ask question as you a section and get an answer train is the best out there so far i wish i had the time away from regular job to follow along love i have been through at least 5 book and deal your is super so far final i can get from start to finish on a lesson without wonder on thank wait to do more take and how much time doe it take to develop and develop as a whole is a boom career the demand for new develop at all level far outweigh the barrier to is not as high as one would think - though passion and hard work are a in or other field is not aim to take you from to junior develop in three month the app you in can be use on your portfolio so you have to show when you for job learn the use to develop all and mac app a new tool that allow develop to a server side in and learn the latest platform from connect with third like and more learn how to use graphic builder core store data on your with the core data learn how to us git for version control and into your app to control flow and what is object orient program method model view control common class and draw and graphic core data control open through dock or through spotlight search a new project \\t select view in the app pane other option are tab and an that no code view allow us to have a project will all the code written that connect one plain view upon open the app fill out project data as shown in video be sure to select for and check storyboard and refer count go over what these mean in depth but for now start our project with them select is where all the file in your project are you can search for thing error and add break point among a host of other thing when you click on a file it content will be shown in the center screen to view two file at hold down the key and click a file the inspector you can add element to your you can the size and physic of those element here you error you will ) is where they show up as shown in the video all of these view can be with the three button on the top right of will be use each of these area throughout the so you will have of time to get comfort with them refer the code that written to the text is as will learn what all of mean but for know how the statement between the brace sound somewhat similar to is not by but instead a of the program in which most app are written in dot and can be read as text is equal to hello class \" right now the word sound a but bear with way of say \" play around with the inspector area on the right side of the click on your label and see if you can background to green and make the font a bit bigger the best way to learn is to so go ahead is a user element that allow for user to tap on a field and have the keyboard pop up which allow user to enter input like my name is or they want to write function like is use if you have a form in your app and you want the user to enter their email and password \\t ad one more view control object to your storyboard and then transit or in speak to that from your view control with the world on it to do you will need to add and a button in your project \\t make sure to click the as your type push can be use when use and are the that will give you a back button for free if you select like a modal then the new screen will be present with no way out you can by click the on top of the arrow that link your view control and press \\t is a great and popular way to transit from screen to screen in in fact if you take out an right now and open up a few of your app you will be to see it look out for the bar on the top of the screen section is avail in 8 have all of the asset for the in a spot in case you have find them later on name in are written to be crystal clear the method call time our view well did load hold true for all method name like and as we progress through the we\\'ll learn quit a bit about method name and how to construct them is a great tool for that might be difficult to understand upon first a lot of the time it might not be at first what a block of code doe and therefor a comment help reader of our code to understand what is be done and reader us too down the line time after write code you will have to go back to it to maintain it or fix it and code will be much easier to fix is good to get in the habit of comment out your code my comment over the top and even call you want to be comment line of code with time you will be to find your perfect comment the use so far we can add subtract and them a tip to prevent later on that algebra the must be assign from the left side for int x = + is a valid statement + 3 = int x will break your program those of you who have gotten a of syntax is a way of an object an is to hold text all you need to know for now to avoid space between name use symbol in name and use keyword like new and \\t here are some common token we will be use in the we\\'ll be go over them quit a few time so you\\'ll have of time to get comfort use them \\t for \\t for \\t for float \\t for object to refer the code against your written code the code the code can be found \\t a lot of new stuff method class method and don\\'t we will get to what all stuff is but we want you build now some rather of concept you will see later code can be found statement allow us to test is number greater than less than or equal to a for now we are just print out differ statement to our base on the logic in the in the we\\'ll have differ bit of code run base on our us with an to state think of state as a light switch which can be on or off in our program could be ha the user log in if ha then the state is ye if not then the state would be no we can test a type with a that we learn about in our last statement what is in the on a is a common error when learn program to use a what we have at our \\t time you need to your age of app to make it a more what do i mean well our convert wasn\\'t so hot 1 human year doe not equal 7 dog year so how do we it a good answer will use \\t again best of luck if you want to show the exact age the with loop allow us to repeat a set of logic a fix number of time they are use so we don\\'t have to write the same line of code over and over again out the project on good luck \\t time to start a new project again we\\'ll be do some background work for the next 4 section trust me put in the work and gain a bit of understand about the will payoff when you start code later don\\'t we\\'ll be get into build a more visual appeal soon \\t one \\t prior to 5 file were use although we discuss them right now they are way to graphic are the blueprint for how object are made think of have a blueprint for a car and have to make of them the class is the blueprint while the car are object we say that they are of the class order to make our own class all we have to do is go file new file and click class then need to name our file it is import that we start with a letter all class name begin with a letter we want to prefix our class with two or three letter to distinguish it from other class these letter are default by the class prefix we when we setup our project in the h file all other object that or import class get access to with java other mean that h file is public if a by a h and m file the h file would contain what is on the screen and the keyboard as ha access to the intern or how the would work would not be here but would be in the m all the inform that we in the h file we must also implement that inform in the m is critic to do if we tell other class that we have implement a method in our header file but do not tell the what to do the program will break order for the implement file to be of what in header file it must first import that file we import we need to give an area to write our or the method from our header file so that we know where to write code class tell you to begin with the and the class name and tell you where to stop write implement with all method must be between these two keyword \\t what you see get call just our view come on screen and therefor make great spot for set up code and test code cannot yet the object we have not import or told the class about our brand new class \\t import and that it \\t we now have access to what ha made public or it ha in it h file now we can start talk about in our the mean local while the mean system we will take a look at an of the in just a second we use which tell the import statement to find my own header \\t each of our class and file do not know about each other unless we import them their header file it is good to keep import to a minimum and do so when is the most way to an object is a class method call upon our class which return an of that class is an method that is call on our new the it for use you will differ syntax to an object the method call use and is again the most way to accomplish feat that you should be call and and never at time might be much more than code such as make sure we can repeat the step think of a that a dog ha as and add that as a to your class set your to in your method and that to make sure it set can return a that can be assign to a method in such as can return either or a we the type of the return of the follow the hyphen or symbol both and that the method doe not return you get stuck checkout the video in the next a method that take one an and print to the whole number between it and 1 it and 1 ) for if we pass in 3 your would a new method that take two both and print whole number in between them the for if you pass in 6 and 2 your would a method that with a return type and an argument that return the ( ) of a number give it a if you have not heard of be care pass in too of a number get big fast if you are have out the make a method that accept 1 argument and return an our first problem we need to a new method method take 1 of type int that we add a colon and then the type in follow by an name we have our method setup it is prudent to test if the pass to method is greater than 0 we confirm that it is greater than 0 we use a for loop to down from the to 1 each time we go through our for loop we print the current of i to our \\t our second problem we need to a new method method take 2 both of type int pay special to the syntax below each argument ha a name a type and a name for in our method below we have the \\t \\t int \\t \\t int \\t we have our method setup we need to do a bit of logic use an if if and an comparison we can test 3 bit of logic the first comparison we will do is if the two are the same in case there is no need to print out number between the two they are equal the second comparison test if the first is greater than the second in case we from our first down to our second print out each in between in our third case we from our second to the first \\t to our third problem we need to a new method method take 1 of type int but also return an our first two problem that instead of use void we put int in the at the begin of our method of our method each time we through our for loop you your answer by your current index for 5 would be equal to 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 \\t a onto our screen make sure your is a 4 inch if you the 3 5 option you might have a bit of your screen miss on your bottom the same way that car had of color and brand and dog had age and breed our view control ha an and back to m so that we can set the last of our dog we need to give the dog a so that we will be to our is of type to match that the right side of the must or return a object we know that the method take one argument in case a string which seen with with method search for an name st and it find file it convert it to a object and return object is peculiar is that is a class and not an object is therefor known as a class method a concept that will be touch on later the bright side there are two type of method so now seen both type the first type is an method which we call on object and class method which we call on class other note we move i want to that be care with spell and is to program just like an essay submit to a would be mark off for spell and the will not understand you even if you are off by one letter can be when you are start out in the long run the feedback the give you an essay submit to class where you must wait for your professor to mark out in red ink all your the can give you feedback we need to get our dog on the screen well i think we have seen similar thing the bottom of write the follow \\t check out the object each inform about a dog we use a differ name within our method although it might seem intuit it is worth repeat that we do not use the same name design differ dog more than of a method also that each of our class can set it own to further what it is or make it more after enter the code below we will have four object if we the object we previou \\t = - may be download from the handout section that we have 4 dog we need a place to store them our come in the form of a which is a contain for object we can also think of an as an order list of object a is also an object itself and is subject to all of the rule that pertain to object that we have far we\\'ll learn more about in a video we will be access our from method it is prudent to make it a local which exist the scope of a particular method retain their and name in all method in our header file the that we have a name that point to an object in order to start use our we need to or the object forget an object as a doe not mean it is among other thing an that may be access throughout the class go to the method in our m file and below our recent dog add the follow line of a contain for our dog can think of it as a kennel i still within our method add our dog object to our array to accomplish we call a method call which take a argument argument expect type of object which is we see id as the argument type we\\'ll learn more about id later but for now id is an pointer to type of object to add the \\t \\t \\t \\t name ha all of our dog object as a good use the function to print our array to the will reveal a list of address although they look like each of those correspond to a dog object our contain is work we use the token when log object is a subclass of which mean that it ha all the function of an be an is also allow to add and it own object an is an but with extra don\\'t we just use it all the time we want to access object in an we can do so by their the index is a count start at 0 that keep track of an object in an array the method is implement by and return an object for a given index that if we to access an index that doe not exist in an array there is no object at that our will crash the first index in our array is label as the index - not 1 in accord with number you are feel smart today or are crave some take a look at are just a few use method implement by and you have a take these method out for a spin and see if you can make each one work be sure to check the document for other document is a access the document you can select help from the top menu bar command + shift + ) then select the help option command + option + ) you can also hold down option and click a class name in your code - how the search bar to i would recommend take some time to look over the document for and at the least - these will appear in you will ever write better know what they are of so that you don\\'t have to write the code yourself order to the dog the on the screen there is a need for a user to be to interact with our we accomplish by ad a word for on a when the user hit button voila a new dog \\t what happen when that is press let step through the code \\t a type that is equal to the number of dog in our array \\t a between 0 and - 1 that match the of our array is a function that return a pseudo random number between 0 and number \\t we are use the modulo % to scale our random number to an size \\t that we have a random index we can ask our array to return a dog for given index \\t have our dog let our element to match \\t a we can see that we are also to alter our how although we do not have it as a of our it is pass in as an argument to our action method the button is refer to as within the method \\t the to \\t sign me up admit video is a ahead of the but who doesn\\'t like some extra credit i have to show it out the follow line of code below for your element to comment out a block of code you can first highlight it and then press and the code i said there is a lot new here but let break it down into stuff that we do know or at least can give an guess about you do not have to understand that is go on here is a method implement by wasn\\'t kid when i said had long method it is known as a class method and is call on a class and not an object we will see more of later number that is pass in after we pass about the yet the of show two look how not but it doesn\\'t take much it is to add such a complex effect as doe a lot of work for you without know what code say are good that you could have guess what is doe is meant to sound like you get stuck check out the video also plea note that the video is miss one line of code to the so check out the note video is miss a line of = below for in the code \\t when you hit the new dog button it will not show you a new dog uh oh isn\\'t what we sign up for \\t the problem is that we actual see the same dog that is when we a random dog from our array it happen to be the dog that is on screen is the first real bug that you will although there are way to fix it it will a bit of out of the box think \\t need a hint i would keep track of our current index by make a ) if we have that inform an if statement could be use to check if our new index is equal to our one \\t also interest in where the term came from feel free to check out \\t in h the \\t in our we start with the same dog is a result of the code we wrote in that set up our view as a result we need to give our current index an as well in write the follow line of code to set our index to 0 \\t great now that i have an for my i next need to my method to test if the is equal to my random index my first if statement below test if the save and the are the same it also test if the equal 0 if both of these are true we need a new number so we add one to our random index and then the view with the dog next we test if the and the random index are the same if they are we subtract one from our by subtract instead of ad we won\\'t run the risk of exceed the number of dog in our array object have a common ancestor known as in other word all the class we deal with will have base function and behavior it would be a great idea to check out it document ) you do check out the document you will that implement both the and so that class can of so is class can call these method that class progress down the class they have all the behavior of their parent and that is they gain function for an is an and more that we have a class we can add behavior to it that is particular to a a is a subclass of a dog it inherit all the function of a dog and can add to it a also ha a name breed and the other in our class a is a dog it can be use a dog is use there is no restrict in ad our to our array you have never dealt with inherit it can be a don\\'t if you are with the concept now we will inherit countless time throughout the so there is of time for it to sink in \\t while class inherit function from their parent there are time where a subclass will want to act differ that is it won\\'t share the exact function of it parent to accomplish a class can \\t a inherit the method bark from it a dog a doesn\\'t quit bark like a dog in case the need to the bark method \\t the method bark is call on a object it will respond as a would with a whimper \\t you should note that a subclass inherit all of it behavior whether public or in order for to help with the the and method must be in the header file it is to a method in a implement file is and usual frown upon the section we learn that it is to a method in our class we inherit and implement custom function for a method it is also to extend the function of a method in short for a method in our super class we can gain access to all of function and then add our own on top accomplish we use the super keyword caught a of in the m file we saw a parallel in our class we can call our implement of bark and then add our own behavior if we would like is quit common to have a subclass implement it implement of a method and in turn that implement it own implement with a sort of occur up the with a method implement behavior from ancestor stack and the heap are two main way in which data is store in we need to store our and inform so that we can pass inform around stack is for local that exist within the scope of a function such as float or are store in the stack heap is where object live object can be in size and it is more to access them through an address rather than each object ha a address which can to the * when an for = design that hold a address where the object live well right now it might be but the key takeaway is that object and are store in differ object be in size are store in the heap while are store in the stack to our is an object you call and on the class to a new one and the hold a pointer to a string object of the object we will use have in front of them like and is of that these two letter are there for the same reason we ad a class prefix to our class to avoid that we have been expo to object we are to the syntax are use frequent and ha shorthand or a liter syntax to make code easier to write and read time you have seen it shorthand for and a object an use a liter the same effect as use the and method is use so frequent it is that you check out the document in detail there are power method that have been written for we can the word in use the method method return an of string is no harm in play around with these method and see what they do let make sure we understand each line of the code again that our index word start at 0 and not 1 is a of our array start at index 0 next our upper limit is less than but not equal to the number of word in if we go over we will get an error in our origin for loop we that all object in the array are string if we had ad type of object other than to our array when we attempt to call a string method on the object our would crash i you to for yourself through the object of an array is such a popular task a quicker shorthand method is avail known as you haven\\'t been pay popular the fast way when you write an statement you are actual implement two method and an to store inform behind the scene - you do not see code in the implement file in our class we an refer to as is store as an under the name is an adopt convent when name with avail to us we are to both write set and read it get the and method that have been written when you a their correspond are as the method will allow us to the of the the name method will return the current of the the last is what we are actual read or write the itself in code the of an look that if you have all the code written your code is now synonym with your mean you can get rid of it obviou is a much cleaner approach to accomplish what is in dot is a or short hand for a method call when we use the dot on the right side of an equal sign we are implement the or the method when we use dot on the left side of an equal sign we are set the of an or use is a contain that we can use to hold object a hold these object as an order list of pointer or refer to our object store in the heap it is also mean that we our array object we will not be to add or object from it an we can use the custom to our object with a set of object is it save us from have to an and then add 1 object at a time also ha a perform over they are simpler object look below for an of our custom \\t that the last item we ad in our nil tell the program that we are done ad object do we have to do without nil our know we are done ad object and our program break a or can both accept type of object for we can actual have an array of an array is known as an emb array and is actual common in program is an of a a data type inherit from the c program in simplest form a hold or group float and under one name to a we can use the follow the of the * seen with object a is not an object access the within a we can use dot for the x of the point can be by write again that we do not use either strong or weak a not an object is to nest if statement within other if statement is common when you want some logic to as you would when the outer comparison is true nest if statement lead to code that is difficult to read to join comparison with or to code is to a button use the method we will cover in depth in a video for now stick with use option will allow you to your in code for we could my method in the class m file in with the follow bit of code can also hide the button from the user use the hidden if we set the hidden to ye the button will from the user mean that not can the user not see the button but they cannot interact with it as well set the back to no reveal the button more can also as a way of user or for lack of a better word show them an alert to an of look through the follow code for now set the to that in order to have the alert view display on the screen the method must be call on the alert view object we want to a of a given class in our header file we must first import that class into our ( stand in contrast to our import that occur in the implement file ( is import to note that you want to import into header file and when import bloat your code is more to and run then there need to and is not a good design will clearer as we begin to discuss popular design pattern in develop in it is legal to send method to \\t project will be the most assign at the end of assign you should have a understand of each of the major concept touch upon in our first two week while it might appear at first success of the assign should help you grasp key concept in program a pillar for the rest of our class \\t let me state that is meant to be a but if you break up and it in chunk is build of length will allow you to put of the concept learn so far in an context \\t when approach project we recommend work on one part at a time as such we have broken assign into part \\t you are to custom your and attempt the problem on your own view the video the do not the way to assign if your meet the then you have that problem what is offer is and clean code that may prove to be a help comparison as you work through the assign final assign is meant to take some time to \\t the at it heart is a game the should have a system we recommend start with a 4 by 3 rectangular system user should be to to differ by press one of 4 direct arrow tile are object which will the inform to our view when a valid movement is not the button should be or hidden \\t use a tile object to the inform mean a class call tile that will have that we can use to our view a a background etc you can these in header file then when you of your tile object you can set these and group inform for your view \\t the game should also a object it should have health weapon and armor stat the first two may be but the last two should be a class that you mean you will have to a armor and weapon class both of these class should have a name and or a health where \\t the view should contain at least 1 label that should display a for our game there should be at least 1 button that allow the user to do a specif action base on the current tile there should also be an area to display your stat health amount amount weapon name and armor name \\t to the tile you should implement a class sound complex but in it is straight forward the class will as an between our model and our view control we should a method that return an of tile object within method we can of our tile class and set for our tile here while not it is recommend that you 4 array that contain 3 tile object we then recommend wrap all 4 array into a array and return it from your method is call an emb method and discuss in the video \\t when user tap on the direct button the should be to which tile to make your should also the inform on the view user should also be to interact with the with the action button in the action suggest interact could pick up an weapon armor or some health effect either neg or posit \\t there should be 1 object in the at a given time and that should have 1 weapon and 1 armor therefor if an action the weapon you will have to how to the old weapon armor and effect ad the new armor and weapon inform should be display in the stat \\t to finish the you will need to a boss class like the the boss object should have a health stat so that we know when defeat the boss user should be to fight the boss on one of the tile time an action occur that may our health we should check to see if our current health is 0 the fight with the boss we should check to see if the boss health is 0 if our boss die we lose all of our health we should alert the user they have won if we die at point in the we should be alert that we lost the game \\t final the user should have a way to start over add a button to your and it reset when the user press button reset the stat to their set the start point back to 0 0 and reload the view \\t we will task for those student that want to push forward and attempt some problem on their own these are recommend and are not core to our curriculum let me stress that these are meant to be in case you will need to come up with invent or do a bit of research best of luck \\t random tile so that your game is more you start at the same place but the of the boss and is left to \\t right now if a user want to an action they can to a new tile the button for certain tile so the user must an action they can proceed for the final boss fight lock the user in so they can not retreat until they have gotten attack at least by the boss \\t add to tell a better and make it more interact for a user pick up a sword put up an alert that say user take sword \\t add an class for our an item class \\t do some with your and health number so that it is for your user to lose if they take the wrong path but also for them to win if they take the correct path through your game \\t part set up the storyboard a basic tile object and a \\t part between tile ad a background and the \\t part ad weapon and armor and ad their effect to our project \\t part ad a action to our \\t part final boss and reset \\t the recommend step below are not the way to assign as much as you can and the assign base on the and use section when you get stuck or are of how to proceed \\t the first thing we need to do is setup our view set up our view will give us an idea of where project is head and will hope get us think about how our interact with our view \\t take a look at the assign video for feel free to take some artist ) the background is a and as a nice touch i set my contain object to be partial i set the on them to alpha may be found in the inspector and ha a between 0 and 1 \\t although our tile object will be use to our view we recommend you start with a basic until you can get the tile as you on your system \\t final you should your class the method should look like \\t \\t i recommend 4 array that each have 3 tile object like \\t = \\t = \\t = \\t = \\t then an array to hold each \\t = \\t now that we have a setup we should use it to our tile array in our view control we also need to setup an point for our user to start at in our system i recommend use a for both in the h way will be to access your current point in all method as well as your tile \\t forget to a we use the syntax \\t each time we set a new tile as our tile we need to hide button that are invalid to do we can use the hidden for that will hide the button on the screen can be set to a ye or no i recommend put into a method so that we can function throughout our \\t we should call method in so that when our view is setup our west and south button will be hidden \\t we should run a test on all 4 button to if they are valid can be accomplish by take our current point and either ad 1 to x ad 1 to y subtract 1 from x or subtract 1 from y on new point we have to perform 4 test if the point pass all 4 test it is a valid or if it fail of them the tile doe not exist we should check to make sure that our y point is greater than or equal to 0 and that our x point is greater than or equal to 0 to confirm that our point is our lower bound to test our upper bound we should check to make sure that our x point is less than the count of our tile array we should also check to make sure that our y point is less than the tile array contain we can access tile array tile \\t now that you are to hide your button you need to actual implement the function for each of your connect to the arrow button if for the user press the north button the current point with self = x self \\t final you have the between tile work which you should be to confirm visual on your storyboard as your should from read 1 to + time to you add a background to your tile object and make your more explicit then use that inform your view \\t it is import to learn about class and one of your class as a in class \\t first a weapon and armor class the weapon class should have of and name of type int and respect the class should have of health and name of type int and respect \\t now you can a class a weapon armor and health in order to a of type weapon and armor you will need to import both the weapon class and armor class into your header file not your implement file \\t next an of in your you should setup some set your start with a weapon or armor you should give your an amount of health and you can to give you the will have to import into header file your method might look like \\t \\t that we are return a from method the need to import our class into our header file \\t final in your h file a so you will be to access throughout your class then your in you should finish by your inform onto the view \\t now that we have a of our and we can through our time to add action to our \\t start by your tile for your header file should now have a a background an a weapon armor and health effect \\t now in our we can setup our tile to all of these for a tile in our might now look like \\t now our tile know that action is to a specif weapon or armor or health effect all your tile so that they have an so that we can our in our storyboard also add armor a weapon or a health effect \\t when think about where to implement function that we have an call it would make sen here to test if the current tile ha either a weapon armor or a health effect with it here use an if if and statement we should be to test which our tile object ha for \\t that we first our health by the old armor ad our new health benefit then we our current armor to the tile armor \\t a boss class it should have a health depend on your implement it may also do or you may as a health effect as part of the boss a method in your that return one boss \\t as we did with our object i would recommend have one boss in our class we will need to track health stat for the life of our view control so it would be prudent to make our boss a you can use your to setup your boss in the method \\t time you do an action you should test if your health is less than 0 now that you have a boss you should also do an if statement to test if the boss health is less than 0 final it would be great if the user were alert if their health fall below 0 in which case they lose or if the boss health dip below 0 in which case they can claim i would recommend use a \\t if you sure how to do check out the video and you can see it done by hand order to get our work we need to setup our we should adjust the background for each of our we will our view we will start with the stat we will be the right column of label so you can name these that is help to you next is to the action final we need to is the let add 4 button that will as our compass point make sure to add these onto of the but below the up all of your view element to your header file for organ i recommend keep all of your and the will use our tile object to our object we will start by ad two won\\'t be use the for quit a while but will hope be a hint as to the view object that we will need to by inform we will be to access one tile object to our and at the same time will be use a to our tile object there are a of reason to a but in term it let us keep the tile creation in class of the in short our will have less code and will be free to do task of the view the h file a method that return an array of our tile object the tile that will make up our game i tile object for now we\\'ll the background and the name blank to allow us to test and make sure that our tile are we will use a default with tile number we will group the tile into contain or array each contain will as a column in our system we can group all of these contain so that the number of contain we add to our array will be equal to the number of column in our system also use a shorthand here for our final array instead of an and ad object after the fact we an and it with object the method is a custom that allow us to the tile array with all of the contain we can then return tile array from our method now when we an of and call the method tile on that we get an array of contain back the m implement the method tile read more about the design pattern check h we\\'ll two the first one will be a that will keep track of our current in our system we also will an to store our tile array m we will setup our we will first set our current point to a at 0 0 mean that when the user start our game they will begin at the lower left hand corner of our system we use the function which accept two float we want to use whole number for our system so you can enter whole number into the function as well next we will our object and call the method tile on it it return an that we can set equal to our tile we can a helper method to our view we now have a current point with two we can index into our tile array which return a of tile then we can index into the return array and get a tile we set the return object to a then we can use the to our we access the tile and set it equal to our text we need to use our helper method our tile by call the method in make sure to call the method after self tile = if we attempt to call the method hand the method would not work the self tile ha not yet been set the doe not yet exist need to two method the first method will accept a and tell you if a tile exist at that point the method will return a which will whether or not we should hide the button if the method return no the button should not be hidden if the button is current hidden it if our method return ye we should hide the button our if statement will test to confirm that the x and y are greater than 0 will confirm that the test point doe not go below our lower bound to test our upper bound we will confirm that the count of the total number of array in our tile array is greater than our x point we also need to confirm that for the chosen array of our tile array that count is greater than the y point if all of these are true than the tile exist and we return no the tile doe not exist and we return ye we need to a method call we will test each button to see if it should be hidden or not the method return a as to whether or not we should set the hidden of our button to ye or no the we pass in should test the current point if a tile exist to the north south east or west of our current point our view at 0 0 should allow the user to go north and east let use our method to hide the west and south button call the method in at the bottom of the method the user press a valid button we need to our current point valid button and the inform on our view we our current point if we press the north button for our y point by 1 now that our current point is at a new we need to which button are valid from call the method to or hide base on need final we can our view with the new tile the method find the current tile base on the current point it is import that we our current point use function m let our tile object first add the to your project make sure that the project target is select next the 1 2 etc is bore that our tile object have been let them in our view in our method add the follow line of code at the need to both a weapon and an armor class we will use these class to object that will have both a name as well as a and health effect for weapon and armor respect we start with these class we will be a in our next video the will have a of weapon and armor allow it to these both weapon and armor make sure to subclass the header file should have the follow that we have a weapon and armor class we can a class we will use an of class to store the player inform will a weapon armor health and a new class that is a subclass of first thing we need to do is import both and into our in the past we have import in the implement file and of class as need in case we want to that are of class weapon and armor in order for our header file to be of these file we need to import them into our h file add the follow import into your h let setup the for our class could our in the m file in order to stick with the design pattern been use so far let our in the we\\'ll be return an of our from a method we need to import our class that we have our method setup we need to implement our method first we an of our class then we setup for our these will be the our player will start with at the begin of our game we setup our health to next we need to an armor object an of our armor class and assign a name and a health stat the class ha a of armor we can set our armor to the armor object we we can do the same for our weapon by an of our weapon class we want one object in our class at a time and we want to be to access all of our method it is prudent to make our a we will be in our header file we will need to import our class in our that we have a of class we need to set it up or give it an a great place to setup is we know our object will be all other method in class will be call after we a method in our class to return a object we setup method to give our such as armor and we use our earlier to our tile object we do not need to in the add the follow line of code after the creation of our object we need to the so that our view can now show our health armor and weapon add the follow line of \\t in order to add weapon armor and health effect to our we need to our tile object the data in our tile class mean that tile object will have of weapon armor a health effect when our user press the action button we can from our current tile what effect should be to the we will use these to the armor weapon or the \\t we need to the tile header file to these new don\\'t forget to import both the weapon and armor class we\\'ll be with these class \\t now that our tile object ha we need to our class the class is for our tile object in the follow we add a weapon armor or a health effect to each of the tile we can the that we made to our tile in the last section a good first step would be to the we both an and an for our action button therefor we can use our for our action button to the of our button at the end of our method add the follow line of order to our we use the method method accept 2 the first one is an which we set use our the second argument expect a control state we will learn about control state in the for now use should now the next to our tile class that we need to implement is the weapon armor or health effect let a method that accept 3 armor weapon and of method we will use if statement to test if a valid object or number is be pass into our method if it is then we adjust our do we have to test if the object exist when we our tile object we were not to add a weapon armor or health effect for all of our tile we ad one of these we don\\'t want our method to all of the we want for the valid can use nil as a to test if an object exist it is a pointer to or at all in effect by say object nil we test is the object exist our health effect is an we test if it is equal to 0 instead of nil we use nil to test if object exist now we add an statement at the end of our method in the event that is nil or 0 is the case when we first run our the user ha not press the action button we want to setup our by factor in the effect of the weapon and armor current for our accomplish all of these item we can add a helper method of the m file we have a method that will use our there are two we should method the first is in so when our first run our armor and weapon stat are account for in add the follow line of that we pass in the argument of nil nil and 0 as a result our statement will trigger also want to call method when the user press the action button in case we should use the armor weapon or health effect we ad to our current tile object should be a hint that we will first have to out what our current tile object is we have a of tile that we setup in we can access use the syntax self tile and index into array use the method we use our current point to access the proper tile final we\\'ll use the return as the argument for the the follow code in the method name order to implement our final fight with the evil boss we need to a class to model it a class that is a subclass of name boss it is add a of type in that ha a name health that we have a boss class let setup the in our our method will return an of our boss class be sure to import the boss class in our header file want to setup our boss in the same way we setup our in our class we want 1 boss in our at a time and we want to be to access that in all of our method of the class as a result we should a of our boss class in our header file and than we can our boss in the method that we have a boss we need to health our final fight in the method we will first test if we are on the tile a to out would be to check if the health effect is if it is then we know we are in the final that boss doe to us time we attack him i will note that is far from a perfect to check which tile we are on if tile had a health effect of we could our program into think we were fight the boss when we were on tile is fast and to cement if statement so we\\'ll with it we confirm that we are on the final tile we the boss health by subtract from it that we have our boss fight setup let alert the user if they die or if they defeat the boss we will use an object we use the custom which accept a few for now we will use for all of these the first one is a which will appear at the top of our next we will send a to the user we won\\'t be use a for now we have not learn about them yet so set it equal to nil we need to also give a way for the user to close the which is known as the cancel button button need a which we set use a string final we will not have other button so we set option equal to nil we have our object setup we need to call the method show on the so that it will appear on our screen last step of our assign is to a reset button for our add a to your storyboard and hook it up as an action to h of method add the follow code to reset our adjust we can make to clean up our project is to group like method in the implement file use mark we can keep our code organ and easier to allow us to type in command into our shell and interact with our is a way to through our file and enter in git command - list all file and in the current to name with space that if your ha space like name with space make sure to use the proper forward and backslash project - make a call project test - an file name test - ls allow us to list content of a file the of the flag that tell the list to print out all file and even the hidden one - allow us to to the the current + c - to abort a long run command enter in - by itself will take you back to the home - the file name be care with it won\\'t move our file to the trash it will it setup git for our project make sure to your project with version control a on if you wish to keep your code make sure to select option in order to have a you must sign up for a paid account use git to the proper where you have your project store add - stage your for the next commit commit - commit the stage file to the the with the add origin - set up our local to be push to our we set our name to origin and a after push origin master - the push command tell git where to put our file origin is the name of our and the default branch we\\'ll be use is master the tell git to the our code is on made to our project we want to be to push to make sure you are in your project like our git process we need to type a few git command add commit push origin master process is to our process but we setup some we don\\'t have to do step from order to download project we can download the zip and extract it to our desktop we can also do in use the command git clone make sure that you are in the proper where you want to download the project to clone is a popular not design pattern use to make the acronym stand for model view and control to the design pattern give a to code that limit strong depend and allow code to be move around we call code \" model in is the data or concept behind your is not what the user see but it is the inform govern your in a game would be the score rule and number of level view on the other hand is what the user see and interact with you have drag and drop view object into your storyboard control is usual a and is in of link or between the model and view the middleman design pattern the model and the view should allow the model and view to be and can move around you have seen how use the code for a or - no depend control ha access and can with both the model and view seen the control the view in our demo take the best friend for the control had a on the view and as well as the model it the to the and object on our view correspond to our model again the control is the middleman did the control with both camp well first the control import the class allow it to access method and second the control import ahead check the top of your h file ) the framework contain the logic behind etc again the control ha open access to and know about both the model and the view doe our view let our control know ha occur on the screen for when a button is tap is a view are not to know about their control in between a view and a control is blind between the object current in the we will discuss two way in which blind type of occur first is known as when we hook up our button via to our we an where a place on our the button tap it shot a or at the target again the import aspect of is that the sender button for doe not know what it is send it to is import well to blind to avoid depend allow a to function with other class don\\'t if isn\\'t sink in with will the of type of clear although good to be think about now second type of is known as an object such as a can the to object such as a when a view need to know it will ask for inform process is also blind - the in our case ha no idea what kind of class it is type of will be a key in our next where we will use the class model can also talk to the control in a blind fashion we will back to later but in case you are interest right now and would like to do some research is through the and a process call check them out if you are is a it is a compo of a column with number of row although it sound it might be the most import class use to display inform to our user so popular you open an app right now from your are good you will see one not is is use but it is a textbook use to and view to control doe a work is a view object for organ and show data it ask our what to display and in turn our our model get to it and see instead of all jabber are two way we can add a to our use the builder the first and easiest way is by ad a to our storyboard file an method that we will see later is a more and ad a object of our hook up our as our manual and a bit more work than use our as soon as you subclass a a in return to the storyboard file select the in the scene and find the inspector the in your class to match your mint subclass in m file quit a few method chief among these method are the data method the data which is our in case is for tell our how cell to display and what those cell should look like three method touch on inform our the number of cell in each section to display the number of section and what to display in each row a new project and name it of \" if you don\\'t know who dog is i would recommend you check him out on a a and a in your project those element onto your view in your storyboard make the connect similar to what we did in unit convert to from our element into the h file of our our end goal is to convert a number we enter in our text field a number of to a larger number dog you can find common go ahead and write logic extra a on your and put in a of checkout the info section for a of although we will go over the answer in a later video it is import that you these i you that is where the real learn is done so give it a shot i wouldn\\'t lie to you if you have feel free to ask some question on the discuss board and if you get stuck check out the video there is no shame in it if you are feel overwhelm or just make sure you code out the and then it without the video the method when your is to use the real for dog year is follow each human year equal 5 dog year for the first two year and then 4 dog year for each human year after sound like a word problem well it is you will find yourself frequent take what is ask of you and that into code in your project use a for loop print the song of on the wall if you don\\'t know the give it a quick the point of the song is to repeat a set of lyric the number of sung with each round you might not want to your at 0 or 1 for take as a hint method group code in order to a particular goal are sent to an object or class in order to act upon them or get them to do for method we use the syntax for class method we use the syntax to make a method public so that it will be in other class we must our name in the header file in the class that will implement the method implement a method mean the function for that method method name that start with a hyphen are known as method the in statement that the method doe not a return will be cover in a later section either your method name from your header file or take of function to the method name in your header ( file and your implement file ( are forget to the semicolon and add left and right brace to implement the method in the m file for the class in question code written of the brace will when the method is call code is the logic of the method method can take and perform logic differ accord to those the sign at the begin of a method design the type of method a hyphen is for method while a is use for class method the in front of the method our case far it ha is known as the return type a colon in a method name an argument after the colon we give a type for the argument such as and a name in order to access the or local in our implement of the brace of our method or our implement we have access to the pass in time we call method we will an argument of the type the syntax look like for if we add a such as a name we can also chain use our dot syntax for the class a text which can be use to the text of a label we can therefor access our own use use sound at first well like concept in program see a of is the real way to get your ahead around it method can have argument the argument are with the method name which is differ than method in other you may have the syntax for argument for an method might look like the the name or how it would be refer to is the method take three refer to as write long method name can be method name sound much like and by type each we know the type of argument that must be use to success call a method also drag two label to the bottom of the screen the blue line that come up to assist you make plea and drag one label to the bottom left and one to the bottom right make the bottom left label the have a font of extra bold size and make the color white for the right label the make the font medium size and again color white make sure to both label with the bottom of the screen and make them enough to fit the text hook them up in the usual type way give them name such as and add a object onto our view will as the background for our drag in 3 onto our of our these will make up our section we will be ad object of these view we say that each of these view is a of our which is also a of the view that the later we will add view object like button and label onto each of these we can say that each of these a of our the top will hold our stat background color to yellow and set the alpha to 6 the will hold our action area the background color to red and set the alpha to 6 the bottom will hold our area the background color to white and set the alpha to 6 add a and name it

and the team the of mind to know that to the system can be made with short is design to be like a train session where the user can come in know how to program in java and know how to unit test against their java code the time you\\'ll know how to a unit test as well as understand the differ use in test along with the valid command to to write good test will help you to learn how to use as a driver for all of your develop effort go forward with a approach we our standard viewpoint of how we write code now not do we think about do i make code work \" we also think about do i break or more often happen when the user or system doesn\\'t play nice with our code \" is to take you from hour to depend on how much of the work you do on your own or just use from the the lesson and build from the ground up but the last few lesson could be done in order depend on your need ever wonder how to get start with unit test is the for you would also be good for look to implement test in and exist develop effort video is a to our and an overview of what is to come video we discuss what you will and won\\'t learn in as well as some expect about the amount of time it will take to go through video is the first part of two part of an to test in part we go over some of the major argument against test and talk about how test is actual import even if there is a bit more work up front \\t in video we our to test by discuss some test and the unit test we also look at the differ assert and how we\\'ll use assert to pass or fail the unit test \\t in video we go over creation of the unit test in and start our person object and test on the person object work from the ground up after we get the test class and in place we begin our test by test the person class constructor are two set of file for video the starter pack and the finish code i recommend start with the starter pack and work along with me if you get stuck there are some text file that contain finish version of the code in both project if you are press for time and just want to review or if you have the video and want to check your work take a look at the finish version to result or see the end result of part of the project video we our look at test by ad the test and then code the and for our person class there are two set of file for part of the project i again recommend use the starter pack and work along with me the finish version is there for your as well video we test our person object by write the test to the method is work as expect just contain our expect use the contain method of the string class if you need to do more thorough test like valid a specif format you could do that here as well there are two set of file for part of the project i again recommend use the starter pack and work along with me the finish version is there for your as well video we start our of how we\\'ll go about test the which will implement in the person class method can be to implement so we\\'ll take some time plan we get start some good thing to think about will be what input can be sent to the method what specif we want to return and what the order of will be for if one person is greater than less than or equal to person is an import to implement when we are go to be order object it is that an object like person would need to be order by last name then first name and we\\'ll care about age as well we take all three into account in class find the plan spreadsheet and document that i use attach to video for your refer video we go over the implement of the and take the time to work through some of the test the amount of test need would go far too long for the video so a set of instruct exist that allow you to follow through with all the test and learn more about the process with the other test session i recommend get the starter pack and work through to the end the finish code is also avail for you to review video we take the time to discuss how the equal method work and how we can it and test it in our person class again we\\'ll benefit from our grid that help us see which case we need to on for to if two person object are equal video we take a look at write the code and test for the method again we\\'ll do part of it in the video but up to you to it with other video in section we have both a starter and finish version of the project there is also a document for ad test and code to and person class video we take the time to look at how we can test except in 4 with 4 except test we can use the ) to specif the except class that we expect should happen when our code is an and make test for except are some thing to for an except happen test code will stop so we don\\'t want to put test code after the line in our test that we expect to trigger the except we\\'ll need to write a specif test for each except that we expect could happen in method if there are except that could happen make sure to write a test for each one we need to to also check to make sure valid code is not trigger the except a good way to begin to write the test then is to expect the except and have the valid code the valid code should not trigger the except so the test should fail no except is then add the code that should trigger the except and your test will now pass as expect video is a brief discuss of the major differ in syntax between 4 and 3 by the end of the video you should be to write test in either version base on what learn about test and how test would be in both 4 and 3 \\t video is the for our i hope you enjoy and would love to hear feedback you have for me either good

it you with a web system with the premium theme an and web design \\t after you have finish the design you will have learn how \\t layout a visual in and present it to your client \\t local on your to faster develop \\t set up a use on a server \\t upload a local site to a site \\t an page to display develop \\t set up the logo and top menu with \\t set up a blog on own page \\t the text use differ font and web \\t add content and to the page and the post \\t and style up new sidebar widget \\t add social media etc ) link and icon \\t page \\t add and style a slider \\t use media to the design of the site work on all browser and all tablet laptop etc ) \\t design and layout a blog page with thumbnail \\t a contact page with a contact form \\t an email subscript list and sidebar form with to join \\t display a for your site for the address bar well as for touch and \\t much more \\t the link to are link so i may therefor a if you make a of for the theme framework if you do thank you and you can find it that way \\t i would say that of the is so i would take to have the theme framework \\t design is ideal for wish to a i have gone into in great detail so no need to if you have of if you are a web design will teach you how to make a by dig into the code to you to get a site look and act how you want it to \\t the would be use for who wish to run their own web design as you would be to fee for a like 3 is the home page it is usual better to show a client what a will look like the develop stage start here are a few trick for visual in a document in the video we one pixel wide with margin either side the width and height can be or later with size make sure at i usual center the design within that are align left with the browser window ) draw by drag them out from the ruler on the side of the document if you see the ruler go zoom in zoom out can the by go the of the on the is view at a of obviou you will want to work on your design at the can be seen in at the top of the window when deal with logo or graphic element within a design it is better to use vector not raster graphic so when past in your logo benefit of smart object in is that you can click their icon in the layer and edit the graphic in is save the smart object in the document if smart object ha been and use time in the design arrow an icon a graphic a web page can have over a differ element and you will need to be to select them and group of them in order to move them around so group all your layer into layer group of the main area of the page footer sidebar etc ) will make thing easier if the client say we have the sidebar on the side one is that as you work down the page from top to bottom on the document the layer end up stack the other way round i found a way around yet we all love layer style for the to add drop shadow glow gradient etc on to almost it is use when the text shadow effect in browser to use the tool press the i key and click on the area you want to the color from then click on the foreground color at the bottom of the tool bar to open the color picker you then get a hex version of the color that you can use in your mark up click to if you want to access exact color in the design explain if you are work for a client how to best display the visual to the client so that pass the design final finish the page and you save it out as a what do you do do you just send the to the client no put it in a web page for the client to look at in a browser so no as to how it look also a good idea to add hover state or in the page so the client know what get here is the i use to show a center in a you have to enter a height on the contain div if the page is deep the client be to scroll down save it as along with the in a folder on your use and send the link to the client when the client come back with comment just the file as and forget to the name and allow refer to earlier version so download start a new on download put the folder in find the folder with your browser by type run through the process in the of the video but it can be call root all the rest it done here i explain the crucial differ between a child theme and a theme framework i often ask the visitor at my what they would like to me write about and the most common subject mention is make your own theme is a power publish platform which can be made to act and look like just about kind of theme are a collect of and file that the design or of your but they also do much more than that they can also the way the site and the differ for differ page etc there are two main way to a new theme for use a theme framework make your proof as these framework will be along with the core so no way your site will stop work when you the benefit of use a framework is that the core theme code is done and done right when you your own custom theme you are for so if wrong up to you to fix of the lead light in i use to theme from scratch but when i want to add to them like nest comment for i found it would conflict with element of the theme and fix it would mean start again from scratch even if you think you know you will be ask to do not quit sure how to accomplish when use a theme framework like you have the support of thousand of top develop and them there is bound to be who know the exact and best to here are some other of use theme been ye use link in so if you make a through one of the link i may get a i would never recommend to you that i use myself and is i use here is video where i \\t you can and download the \\t you have up and run you need to your theme framework and your child theme you will get your of as soon as you make the it and put it in the folder which as you know can be found in your file no need to touch that folder ever again all your theme will go in your child theme \\t and then to load your child theme download a child theme from the or \\t you may want to the child theme by the folder name and edit the style and the function but put the child theme next to the theme in the folder and it in the \\t of the you make to the child theme will be to the file the other ad custom page certain element from certain page ad area etc these can all be put in the function file here is the \\t if you add code to the make sure below the \\t about get your hand with the to you have of will either be in the document or will be sort out in the forum there are also a of ( lot to get through the page in just go page > add page ) a menu and drag the page to where i want them to go in the menu top menu use to be the bane of my exist but now ha in place the to have a and menu for particular i got rid of the and menu use the theme set and ad the menu in the header widget there is also the to the style of the current page link the hover link the link and the link with you can have menu for child and then link for grandchild you can have these on both the and menu here is my video where you can a page to be a child or grandchild page under parent in the page editor and when you look at the page page > all the child and grandchild page are indent underneath their parent do will also give them a logic to get these page to appear in the menu you just have to drag and drop them into their respect posit in appear > menu again child page are indent under their parent forget to give the menu a name for and set it to be the menu so page in the appear > menu area like will a menu with like plea see the video for a of is be on the i a static home page and a blog page by the set in set > read in a discuss of the differ between a static page and a blog page for the home page a full width page in is be on the i a some that in the menu make sure child page have the correct in the you can actual make as page from the drop down page use method as we don't have a background on site we haven't set one but i explain how to do anyway lot more and here find and to the link color in a menu item give a page a differ to the main head usual they are the same is be on the the first time i saw widget i thought on earth are these useless of do now i think that widget are build that should have pride of place in toolbox widget are self contain bit of code that can be to a area via an intuit a fresh of will give you some widget that you can into your sidebar for and more as you are no doubt the recent post widget is one of the most wide use widget but you can also add other widget in your sidebar by way of certain plugin for the list is endless i of use is the reason you should be use widget not for you to but i of use as a is a great way to a client to edit and page but widget allow level of client interact where they can control other static area of the such as the header sidebar and footer here is an i wrote about ad to with widget client can how post in which get list on an to be with thumbnail and the run order in which all these element appear and all is control within an intuit face it it get much more that the widget area well as said widget are almost too to use that they bear explain if you go into appear > widget on the side of the you will see a list of avail widget in the central area and a select of area on the right sidebar or header and to place a widget in a particular area guess it drag the widget from the avail widget area to the sidebar the then you can the of the widget you may like to the latest post widget recent and the set of the widget you can the number of post or in the latest post if you the area in the widget the element appear on the page without a head so for here is a screen shot of me move and here are the to use set as you can see i set the head to be and get it to display the 5 most recent post with a pixel thumbnail if you want to get rid of a widget drag it from the area back to the avail widget area if you want to take it away from the area but would like to save the set as you may want to use it again drag it to the widget area underneath and sit there until you want to use them again i use my chrome develop tool and here is the style for the widget obviou the of do you find widget difficult or to use is there you want to be to do with widget that you found out how to do yet if so i want to know i think widget are a great way to add client control over area that have been is be on the but what if you want the head or background of one of the widget to be differ to the other no problem by use the chrome develop tool > develop > develop or so for the recent post widget on blog is wrap so if you want to the color of the head case in the code the dot the differ between and in use text widget you want to add a in the sidebar to alert client that you are take new project drag a text widget over to the sidebar and type text widget can take so you can add form use text widget for my with link box etc ) form box code and all sort of sidebar good you may think that system of widget is i would say that the is true it actual add you can use also you can put a specif on each sidebar by use and with as you will know take load speed into account when rank page also i hate wait for site to load so i want to these header button with a minimum amount of and more request here i have social media icon and all of them have state that mean there could be request for just for these button the small but the request to get the that can sever page load so how do we cut down those request by one big here is the sprite i use to the social media button and their hover final here is the list of button you join me in one of these place do you have social media link in your sidebar or header how did you them what do you think of mine are they the right shape and in the best posit more to style up the footer and also as to we have the function front and style as they were at the end of the video is a import video as it us to use in the function of the child theme to the way the theme work you can get the site of page to look and differ without touch the core file you never touch the core file as they get ad widget area to the home page in order to add our slider plugin widget in order to get start will work if you have in the last lesson we bear in mind the slider pull in the first from the post or page it all the the same size to avoid discuss of of and head and more to style them up more and more of our is be access by of us have been stuck with a of to pixel wide which smaller would in size the user would have to zoom in and out to access part of the site away from the site never to return ) in a word ye a web design should respond to a need rather than the other way round i know of no other tweak that made in the last 6 year that ha the simplest way to test a against differ size screen is to your window and see what happen go ahead and narrow the browser window on and see the design respond to the width of the browser have a look at one of the best in my opinion is and here is my test with the if see scroll bar with your site you might start think about design well there are a of to make a the way of do it but it is the best and simplest come across first of all you need to add to the head to stop the from scale the whole to fit screen i show is ad in the function so that it come out in the head of page other than that a question of ad media to your to adapt your to differ size of browser window is pixel wide when view on a monitor if the site is view on a narrow than pixel the design would be pretend the first media we add is for the whole is sit within a contain div so now the will or stretch to fix the width of the browser if it is less than pixel wide with site ha to respond get the to size to the window is put in the main and for the video i use a plugin is the most common on the internet and with great popular come risk of attack manual is much safer than use a script like of theme and plugin the likelihood for for a certain host the thumb which led to thousand of blog be hack i know what i want to well as you can see from video of the best way to learn how to manual is to consult you can also see in my video how all you have to do with the to extract data and display it through web page most user will have no direct with the how you a depend on your host popular host when edit if you are use on a mac go to between plain text and rich text edit the plain text have format icon you may need to contact your host to get the correct name for the need in been do local so far and i have the site how i want it so time to put it on the host here is video on there are other way of do by export and import the for but method work for me basic you have a local and a you just the file and export and import both the to do an under construct page you need the under plugin lot of tweak to do is the case with new is be on the same as ad the slider as well as the on the home page here we add three post widget first thing we do is a new size which we can add to the function if you want to a differ size of than the default of pixel and pixel by you can by ad the follow to the a of pixel wide by pixel high of ad to post from now on the ha the name in the widget of be come on to widget later what on earth are widget widget are way of ad content to part of a the usual area where use widget is the sidebar but use widget in other area of a site as their is to explain to client so in order to our three widget with and excerpt on the home page we first need to three widget area and we do that by ad the follow code in the code three the moment widget area that will be on the right hand side if you go into appear > widget in the see the same three new widget area and allow them to be display on our home page in order to a custom home page we a text file and text file we now have the < < function { if ( ) ) { function ) { = return } } } function { if ( ) ) { ' ) } } function { if ( ) ) { ' ) } } function { if ( ) ) { ' ) } } function { if ( ) ) { ' ) } } function { if ( ) ) { ' ) } } we then add 3 more post to the blog with an in them we then add the post widget in the three new widget area we put on the home page you actual add content to the widget via the appear > widget section in the you can drag what you want into these widget area menu tag cloud list a calendar a search bar here we are use the post widget that come and the differ between the three post widget set in the of post to field here i enter 0 in the first 1 in the second and 2 in the third we get a differ post each time also is our custom size which we in and use media to make sure they look on differ is be on the theme set > content to get the blog to show excerpt rather than the full post and for post edit the post info and the post meta by use the edit plugin \\t the as i mention in an about \\t is when design a for yourself or a client you should take care on all the detail the \\t a also known as a shortcut icon is an file contain a small icon with a particular below are a few you may \\t and look at that one at the end there it you want to be the owner of that so read on \\t although there are free you can download in the web best to have an origin for your site good to design the logo of a site with the in mind you need to an element from the logo that is \\t i have an extra symbol on my logo which i use for the for my site at \\t is a x pixel document in \\t now save the that will the as a or a or a the import thing is that it ha a background save as a amend the file name to even though it an file \\t if you want to a real file direct from you need to download \\t you have the you need to upload it to the root of the server where your index or index or if use is where all the file and folder are \\t even if in the next step you your to be in i would still you to also put it in the site root is social site like when your post are share will just look for a on the root and will put up an default one if they find your \\t in order to get your to appear in the browser you have to put the follow in the \\t if you are use you can put the in the header file between the \\t your it often to show and the browser use the old version instead even after refresh if happen past your address in the browser \\t after design a in some way the bit now come the hard bit you have to get traffic and get contact you from the or buy product go to be do a new about that soon were be talk about how to use tool on page etc to make your site more to the search and be talk in real detail about how you can use blog social media and relationship to grow your and your plea pop by to say \\t call to move to are hard to and if on the \\t first run through all the usual to to the most recent version of the that mark up web \\t and the last point a real more later now on the subject we might as well list the \\t not all web browser offer full support for our old friend internet is the main culprit add the follow code to the \\t markup mean use special tag to the kind of content they contain \\t so the old tag may have been \\t therefor present cleaner code which is all and develop to \\t there is \\t schema on standard of element of web content use \\t is an specif that label content to a specif type of inform \\t easier to give you a first some normal old find on the web \\t here is the same mark up with \\t the two excerpt will display to visitor but the second make a lot more sen to a robot than the first and can appear as rich snippet in the search result page \\t other than keep up with the latest web standard there is more to your site to with schema support

to transform the today then is for you \\t come join us at the \\t so to begin start by address the what is \\t when talk about in the media is refer to as a type of digit or virtual while of is correct also a one \\t at most basic level is a protocol if not familiar with protocol they are basic set of rule that govern how inform is transfer between protocol allow across the internet to link to form a network \\t about the protocol is that of research into have in a way to send digit inform in a manner that is safer and more than ever \\t the of how accomplish a later in the but for now we want to paint a clearer of what network doe and import \\t the most way to think about is to it as an ledger are some good video on that are help for visual learner check out the supplement to for an ) you know what a ledger is an excel spreadsheet record all of the transact happen with now instead of that spreadsheet be on your be maintain by connect to the network and each ha it own more set a ledger record all transact would be maintain by a trust central like a bank and the transact would be flow through that with a ledger though connect to the network use the protocol in keep a and public record of transact happen on the network the system is open and public with an internet connect can use the network to transact with in the world on ledger without have to go through a bank in ledger the are the unit be count and record in the transact or sell a product or in for access to the ledger so on our excel sheet we be track the movement of dollar from to but rather the movement of you have you can transact with over the network with your transact part of the ledger a ledger like is an new form of payment system it allow in the world who is connect to transact with who is connect for by transfer ownership of the correspond and have it be and record on the ledger \\t while the of may best be understood by it as a ledger it is also import to understand as a digit it is a way to money or asset with no trust in way it like digit cash if you have the money you can pay with it if you you \\t as a digit it is base on two use of the payment system today - which is basic the amount and of payment run through the ledger - and on use of the payment system \\t often misunderstood that ha some and then are trade with instead it is more that can transact with in an way and as a result it ha \\t import not to get hung up on the specif of at a given point in time in they are more of a to get trade within the ledger system ledger system then in in direct to the number who are use it \\t in other word like most network both more and more use the larger it get and the more wide adopt it a lot of pay to the price of but isn\\'t the or it but the of the which seamless global transact for the first time ever \\t relationship is a bit more than law suggest the of a network with the of the number of user if about it check out the link in the supplement to chapter for some discuss of and law \\t mention the fact that allow to transact with they trust but take a moment to discuss a more \\t transact have upon both be to trust that the transact would occur as expect \\t when make a transact in person - with cash or by barter - both can do their own on whether the transact is for if trade my shirt for your shirt it would be clear to both of us that both the shirt actual exist and that we are in fact them \\t as payment method have and have start transact over greater the prospect of trust the other ha play a larger and larger role \\t what happen is that instead of transact with the other the transact occur through a central like a bank bank and similar step in to trust concern by both with some that the transact is and that the fund get from person to person as plan \\t for now in have not found a way to trust and payment have never from payment platform while the internet ha the speed and of interact it ha lack \\t for transact the of for ha been take a look at phone call for \\t phone and internet base call have made it much easier for to interact with each other around the world rather than need to be tether to a wall can make call while on the go and across greater than ever \\t and internet base call are far less than land line call are often drop fail to connect or have poor their make them more use to so more popular in spite of their lower of \\t that to a transact \\t if i call you and the call drop not that big of a deal i can just call you right back \\t if i were send you money - and that money never made it to you - that would be a big deal go to send 1 million dollar go to want as much of a as that the transfer will be success \\t where bank - and other central - step in normal when send money over the internet we will work with a bank to perform the transact and the bank will fee to against payment not go through or one of the be \\t final allow us to make and transact over the internet without on bank the fact that the internet and those who use it can be of gave a great present to a great supplement to ) of trust ha been in length by scientist in fact such an import concept that it even ha it own the problem understand the problem a group of of the camp with their troop around an the must on to with each other and in order to success attack need to on one common plan one or more of them may be traitor who will to the other so they cannot send to each other the problem is to find an algorithm to that the loyal will reach agreement and be to launch a success attack action by the traitor term of the problem pose the question of how to establish trust between over an network like the internet more specif how can use the internet to transfer a of digit to internet user in such a way that both safe and as go back to our is ask how they can without fear that are be lost or alter by the traitor while been discuss in the context of transfer digit money the could to other type of digit from and contract to ownership of physic asset like car or approach problem by give and user code these code are what are record on the ledger and ownership of a is by match a user code to a code is then record in what is call the which is the digit ledger that in the network maintain expand on a later in the but the basic are that if of the network record ownership then it is as and a part of the go forward of threshold is that in order to do a fake transact and have it work that person would need to control enough process power to gain control of more than of the network which is a amount and as the network grow back to the now that discuss at a high level what is and how it work take a moment to it in the context of the today is as that can be use as a medium of between equal of work and in way money can act as a store of a unit of account and as a medium of discuss how function as both a and as a payment system use to understand how ha transfer over have adapt differ medium to transfer them and each of these method ha respond to in the method that them use the barter system in which they trade they own for they want medium of in system rang from livestock to grain to depend on what group had in or need from other of these good is not in way rather the have the to inspect the good and their there is also no manner of if one their mind after the deal is quit limit for a few reason first it on have need a of want as it is often there may be an of a common of between the item are not and final perish good in limit of the barter system led to the rise of as a method of transact gold the most popular to use it physic what made gold so good to use is not too much of it will last over time and more to and distinct hard to gold use much like barter there must be a physic of gold for the transact to occur and there is no avail after a transact is also no central author the of gold rather maintain a belief that gold will remain in the in it present while it more to trade with gold than to barter were still limit store and transport gold can be difficult gold not began develop paper money to act as for easier use in the us cash back by a set amount of gold gave way to the fiat money we see today instead of a one to one relationship between paper note and a physic govern that the paper note have and can be use in system the of cash is root in the trust have for govern is back the way is a return to a that is back by it own use as gold is for it physic is for that make it what it is is import to distinguish the protocol from the the protocol ledger for transact that discuss and in order to use the ledger you have to buy some it is the access and to use ledger system for transact that an to while the exact of a might as the system grow and the of the protocol will drive the of the so we can see that use a virtual all that how have transact in the past we still address it might be more to use though \\t of the problem with the exist payment platform stem from the fact that they on central to transact \\t as we discuss transact have upon some of trust in order to trust that money is be transfer we have on central like bank to the transact \\t that come at a price \\t for one the of these payment platform is old and to use lead to have to transact fee to cover their own cost to use system like or the transact fee to pass these cost down the line to merchant and friction \\t in to pay to use the payment rail transact fee are bloat by cost with against credit card fraud bad debt pay for custom support reward program and the cost of cover actual pay off their credit card \\t often lead to credit card fee of for normal transact with cut go to the bank and payment processor import to note that these rate have remain rel the same for \\t think of in the space would find a way to drive those price down but there ha been no real in the space that ha been to accomplish they all on the same system and the bank are with the is where the network concept is so import as bank are no longer a to transact the high cost of transact fee ha been a drawback to the payment platform is not free of fee when send a transact over the network you depend on one of the miner to confirm your transact and add it to the in order to one of these miner to bother process your transact it help to a small fee that to the miner differ from the transact fee of the system is that the network a fluid open market for these fee rather than have them set by the bank or credit card will end up pay the actual cost it take for a to process the transact and it on the in the near term these transact fee are by the mine reward but as product slow the transact fee are expect to reach an equilibrium approach the true cost of process a transact that to make transact simpler and more seamless for and merchant may fee on top of for their but the for to transact over the will act as a to keep these fee at a reason and rate the past level of ha never exist in the space and the market price ha not been down now that we know a about how will drive transact cost down take a look at the rel risk in the old platform not to entrust third with your person or inform in order to use credit card and theft are not a risk when use use cash the risk of run into counterfeit bill with on the other hand counterfeit is not which risk and cost and counterfeit are with so too are a transact is a credit card and cost for merchant while theft ha occur in the past all of these breach have exploit weak to the protocol itself \\t also import to note that the payment system been talk about while standard for most modern western are much less in part of the world \\t in fact transact between differ can be an complex and process in the space have the area of intern transact as an area where is most \\t right now if you want to send money from the us to say in have to not pay fee to but also pay amount the two are go to have differ bank system that actual connect to each other \\t on the other hand is unbound and can be access by in the world with an internet connect mean that the around the world can now transact in the global \\t one of the most use case of as an intern payment platform is the market a is when who work in one send money back to friend or in current put the global market at over billion dollar and these transfer are rife with fee and other that cut out amount of the money be sent interview on \\t nick develop at discuss what like work with merchant who want to accept and the for payment interview on \\t nick develop at discuss what like work with merchant who want to accept and the for payment interview on talk about the problem have transact in the develop world and how can revolut intern transact here to tell you some more about specif about how the protocol work i will the ha at least a basic understand of how money work and i will be smear out some detail to make thing easier to understand if you ever want to know more of the detail you can do research \\t is a digit most think of money transfer as take place physic like give bob a bill for some if ever sent money oversea you might have done a wire transfer which doesn\\'t you hand dollar bill instead you call your bank them you are who you say you are tell them how much to send where to send it and which account to take it out of so we shouldn\\'t be shock at the idea of digit or money been around for a while in the form of wire transfer \\t to understand a bit better first look at how the bank doe the wire transfer the bank ha a big ledger or spreadsheet with all of their person and account inform when call them and claim to be she give them enough inform about herself where she grew up a secret number and the name of her first love to them that she is call the bank want to be reason sure the request is then tell them she want to wire to account and the bank make sure that actual ha enough dollar in her account to pay bob along with all the bank fee and if she doe then they send the money so how bank do wire transfer \\t import in all and how much trust ha to place in the bank for to work the bank ha control over her money the bank ha a lot of her person inform the bank could lie to her about how much of her money is there and she wouldn\\'t find out a posit \\t send is actual similar to send a wire transfer except there is no bank instead of a bank use network digit and proof of work to accomplish the same task of transfer go to talk soon in more detail about each of these but first walk an \\t say want to send 1 to bob she doesn\\'t have to physic hand to bob the to wire money had to herself or prove she who she she had to say how much to send where to send it and where to take it from so a transact which is just a with the to from and amount list and digit sign it then she it to the network the internet and the network start about it you hear sent bob 1 did you hear sent bob 1 did you hear \\' after a few second the whole network ha heard about it \\t miner are part of the network so they hear about the transact and put it in a block with other transact then the miner start the proof of work and when they do enough work they the block to the network and transact to bob out the link for good visual repres to supplement the ) \\t talk about network \\t there are thousand of around the world call node that are connect to each other in call the network who ha a and an internet connect can a node each node is connect to or know about sever other node call their they are call no node is more than other which is the network is call a network instead of a network \\t node hear about transact and pass them around to their peer after a while ha heard about them the all the node to their share ledger the in the same way without trust node more than the other a map of all the node check out the in the supplement ) now talk about public key encrypt digit are a type of public key encrypt key encrypt might sound but the basic idea is the core thing to understand is the idea of a trapdoor function all about thing be difficult to rever to light a of paper on fire but difficult to reconstruct the paper from the ash so a trapdoor function is to but difficult to rever how do the trapdoor function work person ha two number call the public and key we call them key both of them can lock and unlock thing the public key is use to the trapdoor function public so can do it the key is use to rever the trapdoor function and you can do it how doe the digit work take a and encrypt or lock it with your key then you send it out to whoever and can or unlock the with your public key the reason call a digit is if to the they won\\'t be to encrypt it to make the digit they need your key to do that difficult to but to check can be read by but you can write them sort of like a handwritten but better use digit to that is spend money from their own account not you go to a foreign land and you hear about a great wonder of the world there you ask a man name where it is and he take you to a small build and say is the wonder you you wouldn\\'t right would an build be a wonder of the world so you keep look come across a woman name and ask her is great wonder that i have heard about \" and she take you to a pyramid is the wonder you seek \" she say is much more than right the pyramid took a lot of work to make it what make it a wonder is a similar idea except it work with number instead of build import fact about number is that most number are big you proof of work use trapdoor function like with digit but instead of make that is difficult to it use that is difficult to predict i put a number into trapdoor function and hash it as call and it output a differ number in an way if i hash number the output is differ from the output so now if i come to you with a big number that when you hash it come out as a small number that i search a lot of number to find it most of the big input hash to big output most number are big so that special input that come out small like a block in the pyramid of a lot of work you can\\'t just take a small number and run the hash backward a trapdoor function it doesn\\'t go backward so proof of work and from earlier both come to you with differ version of the and ha a bunch of big number that hash to big number where as ha a bunch of big number that hash to small number like the pyramid a lot more time and effort a lot more work small number are rare so her is the one that ha been work on go the with and bob one more time want to send 1 to bob she a say want to send 1 to the transact she encrypt or lock it with the key to her account make a digit then can unlock the digit with her public key to see that she is who she say she is but can it and it without her key digit sign it she it to the nearest node which then begin spread the news of the transact to all it peer who in turn spread it to their peer and so on until the whole network ha heard about it at some point a miner will hear about it and put it in a block which is basic a bag of transact text is the same as number to a so the miner then treat that block as a big number and start search for number to stick on the end of it so that the two number hash to a small number is the proof of work when a miner find that special number the next block is said to be mine and transfer to bob is \\t discuss the protocol explain the and talk about develop in mine the supplement for a breakdown of exist mine pool ) head of risk at discuss hi vision for and

loo the origin are just true and will help you to understand the of these two in your code there are some in built to and these type which are explain in the \\t access like public and protect are use and are use a lot in java know more about them in detail manner via a number of access to set access level for class method and constructor the four access level time we need to assign a to a is known

end of the you will be train in as well as in all these and more are in hour of learn student with the skill to write basic for server pass the to server \\t understand is an acronym for system and is the most popular and wide use system in the world server is avail in 6 differ edit you can pick the one that match what you need as well as your budget of server server studio or in short is the most import tool in the product server studio also refer to as is the main tool of the server product how to use to the and what all you can do with it differ part of and take a look at some of the server that are avail are differ that are store within a file will see how you can and certain object use the tool the main point of lesson some of the object and in a known as is the main for talk to which is differ from server the product is a it is flavor of is call which is a short form for transact contain that are specif to server and obviou work with them with a in to see what it allow us to do you to some statement that allow to object like and in an server platform will see how we can differ object in server use the alter and drop command constraint what they are the differ type that are avail and they are use how to use differ constraint and the effect they have on data within the is an import command at some use of the select statement case is one that let you the way a in a column is display in the result how you can use the differ case for more scenario the select statement you store data in a under differ column each column is allow to be for a data type will see how you can work with string data type in server and store differ type of string data within them first of data type is the one that store exact these have further under them as well how you can work with data and store differ in a how we can use differ date and time type as well as the effect that the date format ha on the in understand date of the data type are meant for special and scenario at some of the data type avail in server how you can use the order by to sort result of a and some of it differ form that you can use to column to sort on in an order by by the column name with comma the sort will be perform in the order of the column given how to use the top offset and fetch for page record the where differ and to filter search result some way of filter data in select for differ type of result how to use string in as well as the and all how you can from at the same time and the way that server understand how server from one must first understand you use in the first place is a core concept of call how work when use at the differ type of join and the differ between each and each should be use with cross join is the simplest form of a join when you use a cross join in a select statement it is function to the case of the name of the in the from how use differ type of show differ result how you can use certain keyword how the join hint are use in \\t see how data can be ad to a use the insert command you will also see it variant that allow you to add data in differ way to the how to add record to a use the differ form of the insert statement third method of bulk ad data is help call an bulk insert is most use when the data is to the how you can use the select select into and bulk insert command to add record to a in one go the statement allow you to exist data in a how to record in a use the command and record to use it where how to data that is record from a in use the statement how record can be from a use the and statement an of server that let you data between two is done use a new statement call that the power of the insert and statement how we data between two use the statement along with the 2 rule about function what they are how they work and how you can use them also see the differ of function that exist and look at some of the most use function within those function are an import part of server by default you cannot mix data type within a statement logic function are use to perform logic in and time function are a import of function and are use quit while use to date the function here can also time as well how to use differ function from differ you'll see how to use them with a as well as with column in with row of data about group data the need to do so and an to special function call function or function or as known are special function in server these work over group of data rather on row other function some of group and use differ to see an overview of data to use in server program and the differ way and place you can use them in \\t see how to and use them in differ place and and use batch flow statement let you behavior a bit by give a differ direct to the statement how to use differ control flow statement like the if and while along with statement batch within a contain about store an program construct in that let you a batch of statement that can be you want you how to a store it and then it to use to make it even more use you may need to use them and the differ type of that are a look at write and see how they work how express can help write more complex differ window function like rank and den rank and the differ between them function refer to as are custom function you can for your own specif use how you can a custom user function and how it can be use pivot is basic a way to take raw data and

       " u'Udemy_Make Your First Unity 2D Game Quickly and Easily!': u'\" know ha been the tool for make game but in recent version they have crank up the good for you\\'ll be to the basic of make your own game in put sprite on the screen make them move input by touch or and ad sound to your game while is aim at to i do play around with some kind of program at some point but even if play around with and some you\\'ll do fine focu on game develop in - start with no code and go on from there design to take place over a but here on to it at your own pace you can get the basic under your belt and at the end of you\\'ll be to put game use you\\'ll just sharpen your brain and head into the first lesson of the the basic of use the how to object and keyboard interact audio sound effect and music use the system and more the scene in the origin video then go far beyond we need a set of graphic for our game follow video to see how to download and import them into our project add a to the and how to prefab or game object we\\'ll an and play around with what we have then see how to save the scene so we can come back and work on it later some code is go to be to a game use so take a look at about which drawn toward or can them both and a quick video explain either is just fine your toe into the world of script for script are way to refer a game object in a script but one of the easiest is avail if we the object we\\'ll how to do that in video as well as play around with the keyword in the next set of video we need a specif scene build an actual ) so we\\'ll that in video an at scene build and don\\'t need to walk through the process again just skip to the last of the video to see what it should look like but i the video if a stuff is still not at point don\\'t it will much easier for you as you keep we\\'ll a script that will be ad to our bomb prefab been miss a way for the player to interact with the scene so fix that now build a new script that show how to fire off some code when you click on a game object with your in the scene again our old friend pay a visit is one of those word that strike fear into the heart of and new game develop but you can think of it as clone a new of a prefab in your code the game clone it with want monster to drift onto the screen head for the heroin drop her sword those monster forewarn there are a concept that i gloss over in lesson such as and the good news is that even with the you\\'ll end up with enough to be clone by midnight tonight that we can i want to all the time so the secret formula for your game object ha a on it a way to get the thing move apart from the physic that we play with earlier method allow you to the object direct you want by ad a to the x or y of the object to dash off a script that work for your current game but smarter is to and think of way to write script that can be use over and over again in differ game what we\\'ll attempt here game the player to move object or sprite on the screen a in a game a spaceship the or a plumber in a game so how to movement is also while there are some more concept in the script we\\'ll be write the code itself is 5 line long my kind of script far dealt with sprite but a cool way to use sprite sheet intern refer to that happen the sprite itself such as a bid with flap wing the wing are a part of the sprite itself then you\\'d use or similar to make the flap bird move across the screen look at sprite sheet is a look a lot more to sprite sheet that we won\\'t get into right now system just are cool they allow you to visual effect without the need for actual artwork much artwork you can billow smoke magic etc use they are the kind of thing that can add polish to your game the first video below as an to touch on what it take to a from scratch go to show you the basic of make a but then switch over and show you how you can use \\t our scene have been so far but quiet fix that by ad some background music and some sound effect when the coin are pick up by the beach ball \\t you\\'ll need to download a zip file with three file in it we\\'ll be use those in section you can find the download link in the section to the right avail on \\t the are in the public domain and the music use is 0 from a guy name carter a link to the page for the song gel game have music play as the pick up coin or find your way through the maze video

that button will be do job make game object vanish script and play music \\t the first part of lesson don\\'t need special just a new scene in project but the second part need a special project so you\\'ll need to download it over on the right not avail on not new to game develop new to quick video show how to fix the i whine about in the video you don\\'t have a true type font lay around to use in lesson check the to the right for a link to a site that ha free font you can download a button to our game see how it is to hook the button up to of our project what we learn in the last section put the text and button element to use in a game if you didn\\'t download the project in the last section did download it but mess it go grab it now won\\'t be a game but it come close and stop you from take what you now know and ad to it \\t the basic of shoot a at the use the at the right to grab the code in video a button to and a game object add some score to the game document in

and the game loop is for drive process our game loop will run per frame of and each time it run we need to process all aspect of our game e g player input physic score etc when develop game get into the mindset of the game loop can help when think about how to certain problem as import that we know when differ event will occur throughout the process of a frame develop a solid game loop can be and sprite kit ha done that work for us and so we don\\'t need implement our own game loop in video we have a quick look at the sprite kit game loop and see how differ aspect of our game state are process throughout a frame \\t a breakdown of how a sprite kit scene process a frame of \\t an in depth discuss of game loop as a pattern in sprite kit the design of the game loop ha been done for us so link as further read if you are in sprite kit allow us to rel add movement and to the node in our game in video we discuss action and the task thing we can use them for and how we implement them perform of our game is obviou import as we want our game to run as as in order to make sure that goal we need some sort of benchmark that we can keep track of the frame rate is the most benchmark we can use for if we see our frame rate drop when a complex event occur in our game it could be a clue to us that we might need to do some in that area sprite kit can report the frame rate to us along with a of

over the next of section we are go to a physic base space shooter we\\'ll be cover a number of differ concept and sprite kit along the way and at the end of it you\\'ll have a fun game to play with be of room for you to expand the game as well if you\\'d like to take it further \\t in video we two class level \\t we setup our cannon and get it use the follow \\t not sure how work ha a nice that explain it video is a review of some of the code ad to our space cannon game so far we discuss action and \\t time to get our cannon shoot in order to do so we are go to need to convert the of our cannon into x and y we can use good old for in video we\\'ll a helper method to convert our and setup a method to a new cannon ball node time we tap the screen \\t need to brush up on your sine and video we discuss a few of the concept we need to know when work with in our game we discuss the constant we have avail to the of pi as well as the function sine and can convert to = * / can convert to = * / video we discuss a number of the basic data type that we\\'ll be work with while develop game we look at \\t to get our cannon ball move we can take of sprite physic by ad a physic to our cannon ball node and give it a we can get thing fire \\t in order to make our cannon ball shoot we the follow add physic to our cannon ball by ad to our shoot \\t we also turn off for all is a review video of the code set up for the shoot method of our space cannon game \\t if we want to keep our perform smooth a good idea to node from our node tree that no longer use by through the node in the tree we can those that are out of bound of the screen and go ahead and them from our scene \\t we set the name on our ball node to make them to we the method our node and those we don\\'t need video we look at how we can use to interrupt the of our code and check the state of our game to help when debug our code if you are familiar with how to use feel free to skip video we also look at how we can use the output window to print out the of of our object \\t in video we have a play with physic start with the standard sprite kit project we a node to a soccer ball and get it move around by a physic for it we see how the and affect our node and discuss some of the differ type of physic \\t as we process each new frame of our state we need to the order in which thing should be process in video we see first hand how the time of when we call our shoot method within the game loop can have an impact on our \\t we delay the call of our shoot method by ad to the video we take a closer look at method and that we have as part of our scene we the time of when these method are call in regard to our game loop by use some log statement to see how the of a node each frame \\t in video we add wall to our scene use a new physic an \\t we also need to a few of the on the physic of our cannon ball so that they maintain their momentum when \\t we add for our cannon ball to off by ad some new node in the \\t we also adjust some physic on our cannon \\t there is much more info on the aspect of sprite physic in idea of is to play with physic by a ball a new sprite kit project for the and setup the project in in portrait orient set the background to white the code that come with the project that the hello world label and space ship node add code to the touch began event so that each time you tap on the screen a random ball is at the of the tap the ball should fall and around the screen you will need to setup a base physic that loop around the border of the screen you can use the frame when your physic you should have differ type of ball at random each time there is a tap each with their own physic that make them differ from one there are graphic for 3 differ type of an 8 ball - should be the heaviest and not as much as the other a soccer ball - a bit lighter than the 8 ball and more a beach ball - ball should be light and setup the basic 3 ball with sprite physic by differ physic are some suggest for thing to make one of the ball make one of the ball spin when it is see what happen when you turn off the friction for all the ball see what happen when you set the friction to maximum for all the ball video we go through the to the ball and have a bit of a play around with the of our physic a new sprite kit project add the 3 ball graphic to the project and the code that the hello world text and the code that a spaceship node the method the background color to the method set up an wall around the of the screen so that when we add some ball to the scene they will around do by an of that ha an base physic use the frame of the scene as the physic the method to a random ball when a touch event occur the 3 ball type should each have their own mass and so that they and

nice on random \\t our cannon is pointless if we don\\'t have to shoot at time to fix that up in video we\\'ll setup a new method to halo node that will float down from the top of the screen we\\'ll use an action to period call method to give us some to target \\t we add some constant for the and speed go to use when set a \\t we add a new method that will add a new halo node at a random posit the top of the screen and give it a random downward \\t we setup a new action that we run against the scene to period spawn a new halo in the video i say that the will be by up to or the rang but it actual will alter the by up to half the rang so that would give us a wait time of 1 5 - 2 5 second \\t spawn halo action \\t more detail info on is a review video of the code implement to spawn our halo we take a closer look at the method and the action we to period spawn halo feel free to skip video if you feel you have a solid understand of go on video we discuss in order to detect contact between node and to control how node react to with other node we need to use bit mask we go over the of how they work so we can start use them up in our project \\t we 3 \\t and set the on our physic \\t by set the on the ball and halo physic we can control how they react when they with other physic \\t we need to take a few step in order to react to a between a ball and a halo first we set the on the physic in the header file for our scene we that we are implement the \\t we then tell the physic world that our scene object should be the to contact final we implement the is a review video of the step we need to take to get our method setup so that we could respond to two physic come into contact with one feel free to skip video if you feel got a good grasp of how we got stuff work \\t in video we take a look at the editor and see how we can use it to design effect to in our game \\t document explain in more detail the effect of the of a \\t we a method to a new node for \\t we then call the method when we detect a between a ball and a \\t seen how we can use the editor built into to visual effect it is also to manual code up a video how we an of an use just code \\t * \\t our game would be too if we allow the player to shoot as often as they like in video we an avail ammo limit of 5 that by 1 each second \\t we add a new to he header file of our the method we add a sprite node to display how much ammo is avail and an action to increment the ammo each \\t the ammo setter allow us to our limit and the ammo display at the same \\t in our shoot method we limit our shot and the ammo with a if the video where we ad shot limit i talk about the idea that we could instead limit our shot by allow a of cannon ball on screen at one time see if you can work out how to implement behavior and make it so that 2 cannon ball can be on screen at the same time are a of way we could our shot limit one way would be to take of our exist ammo but set maximum to 2 we would then need to our action that our ammo over time and instead the ammo each time a cannon ball is from our scene happen in two when a ball with a halo and when a ball move of the screen second way that we could the would be to check how cannon ball node are in the scene when we to shoot if there are 2 or more then we don\\'t allow the player to shoot we could set up in the shoot \\t let give the player a first line of by ad a row of shield their cannon when a halo hit a shield it should destroy both the shield and he halo a new for our our method we add some code to setup 6 shield the the of our halo to the new shield we respond to a contact between a halo and shield in the ad quit a bit of code to our shield in video we review all code in closer detail if you feel got a good understand on how it all work then you may want to skip video \\t in video we\\'ll a game over by ad a bar the cannon that if hit by a halo trigger the end of the game \\t first we need a new for the life \\t we the life bar node in the \\t we the of the halo to the new life bar \\t we our method to take the name of the we wish to \\t we can then our to respond to the bar if you can a new type of mini that occur time a cannon ball off the side of the screen you will need to setup a new effect file and detect when there is a between a cannon ball and an in term of posit your check out the that is part of the object in the method to help get your right next to the video we run through how we can the to display an effect each time a cannon ball off the of the screen first need to a new effect file with the effect you want for the cannon ball need to detect when there is contact between a ball node and an we set up by set the of our physic can then add a new if statement in the method to respond to the contact between ball and we can use the of the contact object pass into the method to posit our \\t we our shield and life bar setup code move it from the method into a a method that we call when we detect a between a halo and the life bar method all the halo on screen and all the other node we make it wait for 1 5 second trigger a new \\t so that we can through all the halo node we need to make sure we give them a is a review video of the code we wrote to setup our game reset function if you feel got a good of the code then feel free to skip video as not go to cover new \\t we setup a new label to display the current score on \\t we a new in the header \\t we the setter method of to the \\t when we detect a between a halo and a ball we the also reset the score when in the method \\t have good art is obviou a big part of game but not all of us are artist there are a number of web where you can find art design specif for game can be use for find art to use in your game even if you just need to test out game concept with and use as art get art design specif for your game you use art from the web make sure you \\t we are about to add some sound to our space cannon game and so found a of sound on org that have some sound we can use \\t * for when our cannon shoot we need to edit sound to the echo \\t * for when a halo off an \\t * for when a ball off an we need to edit sound to the echo \\t there is also a great sound in the \\t these are the origin of the specif sound we are use from the sound \\t is free open for record and edit sound in video we see how we can use an audio edit program like to edit sound to get them for our game \\t core format is the audio format by the so good if we can convert our sound file into format prior to ad them to our game import to understand that the file format is just a wrapper for the actual audio data and so we have a lot of as to how we want the data in the file in term of perform best if we use an data format such as linear when we our file we need to keep in mind that our file size will be larger when use an format to when we are use compress if file size is a concern then may be worth as it give compress on audio file \\t to convert a file to use an data format open a window to the folder where the file is store and then \\t caff \\t to do the same use \\t caff \\t to save time in the we can a shell script to take care of the for us a file with the follow code and name it sh \\t for f in * do \\t caff \\t done \\t if we put that file in a with the file we want to convert we can run the script to convert all the file by type into the \\t sh sh video we use the action to add sound effect to our game it is a good idea if we our sound base action prior to start a game so that we don\\'t get in our when play a sound for the first time to hold our action to play our our action in the method our sound are load prior to start the \\t setup sound run our action we want to play a sound e also tell our ball and halo physic to the as part of their can then play a sound when a halo or ball off an a new class to our menu class inherit from we the method in class to add the aspect of our in our scene we import the header file for our menu a to hold an of our setup our menu in the \\t setup menu our menu class we give the node for the play button a our scene we a state to make it to tell if we are in a game or set to no and hide our menu when we start a new game in the then do the in our also need to check if we are in a game when we go to shoot our we add a touch end event to detect a tap of the play video is a quick review of the method and the code we wrote to check if our touch event within the play button for our menu video we fix up a of to do with our score label we see that we hadn\\'t yet set the text of our label when we load our game then when we do set the text our game slow down while it the display of the text we can fix up by set the text in our method we also hide our score label when not current in a game move the call to set our score into the method of our scene so that the text will be set when the game load we also set the ammo to 5 so that it doesn\\'t build up while on the menu and we hide the score label when the game is in the also need to set the hidden to ye in the method and to no in the method our menu class we add 2 label node to display the current and best score on the menu we set these up in the the header of our menu class we 2 to maintain the score to be then the setter on these to the our scene class we need to tell the menu what score to display we do when we a game video we review the code we wrote to display our score as part of our menu we don\\'t cover new so feel free to skip video if you feel with we did when set up need a way to save our best score between session of our app we can use the class for in video we\\'ll have a bit of a discuss about class what it doe and how we can use it to make sure our score are save to disk need to persist the player high score between session of the app in video we see how we can use to save and load the top score a we can use to access the a to use as a key for the data we want to the method we the with the save in do a save when we get a new high score we call to make sure the data is video we fix up a few bug we have in our game prevent halo from off the top of our if they spawn too close we make the higher by ad a bit of a also prevent halo from destroy more than one shield by set their when a contact i don\\'t show it in video that same line of code should be ad within all the contact test with a halo our method we clean up halo that drop below the bottom of the video we see how we use the speed of an action to how fast it run we set the speed of our action that spawn our halo so that the game get harder the longer the player we run an action on a node we can give it a key so that we can access it again have a speed we can use to speed up or slow down our action in our case we want to the speed that halo are spawn each time we spawn a halo we add code to the in the new game method we reset the speed of our video we setup a new sprite kit file to be use to a trail of flow out from behind our ball node video we see how we can use the to direct that spawn from an to move into the space of allow us to move an node without all the follow it our and add it as a child of the ball we direct the to set it to move around in the system of the main layer trail have a problem with our trail node in that all the disappear when parent node is from the scene in video we look at one for by a new class for our ball node that ha a refer to a trail node we can then add the trail node as a child of the main layer rather than the ball and the posit of the node as the ball move we can also turn off the trail and it when our cannon ball is a new ball class in the header we a and a implement the method and we the method so that we can turn off the trail when the ball is in our scene we the of our cannon ball in the shoot method to use our new can then move the node to be a child of the main layer and set a refer to the on the our method when we through all the ball node we can call the method on each of them to make the follow the video we review some of the code been write over the last few space cannon video we take a closer look at the speed of action and run through in more detail what we need to do to set up the trail effect for our cannon ball video we a limit to our ball take of the fact that we now have a class for them the ball ha 3 time we it next time it hit an a new in the header of the ball when we detect a contact between a ball and an we can increment the and the ball if too video we setup a differ type of halo we give a halo a 1 in 6 of use a differ graphic that an in the number of point we get per halo we spawn a halo we set 1 in 6 halo to be a point halo we take of the of the halo node to mark particular node as a can then check if the halo is a halo when we detect a between a ball and a add a bit more interest to the game with the of a point if the player to destroy a halo their point by 1 and the will score more point for each halo they destroy without miss if the player miss their point will be reset to 1 a new in the header of our then a label node to display the current point setup label in the the setter of our to the display label when the we destroy a halo we the by the of also increment if we destroy a reset it when a ball too time or the is to a bomb power up power up should be a new type of halo with a differ graphic the bomb halo should show up there are current 4 halo on screen and a halo is about to halo should be a bomb halo if the player to shoot the bomb then all the halo that are current on screen should also blow up player doesn\\'t score for the extra if the bomb to get down and hit one of the shield then all of the shield should be video we our for a bomb power up our power up is a new type of halo our code for one is go to be in the method our rule for a bomb power up is that there ha to be 4 halo current on screen we need to get a count of how halo are on screen we our halo when they are not on the screen we can just loop through all the children of the main layer and count up those that have the name can then check if our count is 4 in which case we can set a few halo on the the halo just to turn it into a bomb halo we the and set the to a ye for the key note that we can check for a count of 4 here we haven\\'t yet ad our new halo to the main layer that code happen after so when we did our count we got back the number of exist halo not the one we are in we destroy a halo with a cannon ball we need to check the of the halo to see if it ha the ye assign to the key for bomb we do in the method if we just destroy a bomb then we go ahead and all the exist halo node ad an each time we first set the name of the halo that the detect to trigger to nil so that we don\\'t add an extra for in our method time where we detect a between a halo and a shield we again check for a of ye for our key bomb in the time when we a bomb we instead all the shield by loop through them and call video we our for a bomb power up our power up is a new type of halo our code for one is go to be in the method our rule for a bomb power up is that there ha to be 4 halo current on screen we need to get a count of how halo are on screen we our halo when they are not on the screen we can just loop through all the children of the main layer and

again check for a of ye for our key bomb in the time when we a bomb we instead all the shield by loop through them and call video we touch on the concept of pool we can perform of our game by the object go to need throughout a game prior to start it we are then less like to slowdown if we have to a number of object at as we can pull exist object out of a pool and use them our scene class we a new to hold our then move the of our from our method into the method and add them to the pool rather than the scene our method we can push all the shield into the main layer make sure we them from the we a shield node from it parent we need to push it back into the video we add a new power up to the game the idea is that if the player can shoot a shield that float across the screen they get one of their miss shield return a new method to spawn the shield power up we use the on the physic to make it spin we need to a new for our shield power then an action in the method to period spawn shield power video we get the shield power up work so that we can have our shield return to us in the of a game first need to tell sprite kit that we want to know about contact between a ball node and a shield power up we can react to those contact in the a new action to play a sound when we collect a power in the also make sure we shield power up that to get to the other side of the screen we do in the time is to a new type of power up that will put the cannon into a shot mode when in mode time the player fire the cannon will shoot 5 cannon ball 1 after the other with a delay of 0 1 second between each shot the cannon will also to green when in mode the player will stay in mode until they run out of ammo and so mean that their ammo should not while in mode it also mean their ammo should be reset to a full 5 ammo when they first enter the shot mode the power up itself will use a small of a green cannon and will float from the left hand side of the screen to the right at the same speed as the shield power up a new power up should be spawn for halo that the player destroy shot power up is not a super one to there are a number of we need to make throughout the code to get setup in video we look at what we need to do to our need to have a way to count how halo have been destroy so we a new at the top of our game scene to act as a in our method in the if statement where we detect a contact between a ball and a halo we can the counter we can make use of the to check if the halo just hit is a of in which case we\\'ll call a new method we can setup a new power up go to need a for it physic we can up with our other constant in our game a new method to spawn a shot power up the method a new sprite node and assign it a posit to the left side of the screen but with a random posit we setup the physic of the node so that it will float across the screen from left to right and we also give it a need to the of our cannon ball so that we are of a between a ball and our new type of power do a bit of clean up and in our method by power up node that to make it across the screen without be also power up that are on the screen in our that set up our power up we can start implement it function we a new in the header file of our game class to when our cannon should shoot shot at a the setter of our in the game implement file so that we can set the of our cannon base on the of the when in mode the cannon should be our method we add a new check for a between a ball and a shot power up when occur we the 2 node set to ye play a power up sound and set our ammo to want to allow the player 5 shot in mode go back to normal mean we need to stop our ammo from over time we can set up in our method where we are the action that increment our ammo we can wrap our increment statement in an if statement that check that not in we do our shot it would be if we can just call shoot for each one of the 5 shot our shoot method current contain code to check the ammo and it we code and move it to the point where actual call our method we our call to shoot by first check that we have ammo we also do a check to see if in mode if we are then we shoot 4 time each one delay by 0 1 second from

when not it should use the play the music button should fade in like the play button doe when the menu is brought up after a game video we look at how to add a a new button to our menu that turn the music on and off start by set up the button in our menu class in the implement file we an that is an to as the can then set our to an and posit our button in the need a way to the of our button so we a in the header file of our menu then the setter method of our in the implement file for our menu class so that it the of our button base on the of the want to make our button fade in with the other menu item when the menu is display we can do by run the same action that we run on the play button in the show method of our menu that our new button is all set up on our menu we can start and stop the music when touch we do by ad a new test in the event of our scene if the node we touch is the music button then we flip the state of the on our menu class and then tell the audio player to either start or stop base on the state of the need to make sure that the of our menu is in sync with the state of the audio player at the start of the game so we set it to ye in the method of our video we look at how to add a a new button to our menu that turn the music on and off start by set up the button in our menu class in the implement file we an that is an to as the can then set our to an and

the option we also turn off the bar by the method in the view control to return ye we then clear the code we don\\'t need from the scene class and add the we\\'ll be use to the project for asset video we add the to our game and make it so that when we drag our touch on the screen the move from side to side start by an for the and a to hold the touch in our the method we setup the we begin a touch event we store the of the touch in our can then find out how far our touch ha move in the event and the posit of the need to stop the player from move the all the way the screen we can do by put a limit on how far the can move the event we set the posit of the if move too video we setup a method to a ball in our scene start by a method to spawn a ball the method expect the posit and of the ball to be pass the method for our scene we turn off the and call our method to spawn a ball we also add an around the border of our scene so that the ball will around the screen an is a static are never

concern you don\\'t know you don\\'t know program you want to master c program by self learn way you don\\'t know to learn c program you are enough to think and of the is to even you know about just enjoy the begin wish \\t like other kind of the to and share idea with other and to sit down and talk with custom and get their feedback and understand their need see what the program is all about \\t not good old old good \" \\t quot \\t he might have written for c who know \\t if you talk to a man in a he understand that to hi head if you talk to him in hi that to hi heart have a look at build block of c unit explain basic of standard c program which is for write first c program c statement will come under either of the 4 of of c program viz type statement statement instruct and control of the except control ha been cover in detail use and that student doe not know about of program is given on of operand and instruct unit is by focu on two of the frequent use function in c i e and in c the problem then write the code \\t here is a video that explain how to open base open file write program and how to save the program further two program have been been taken in video and each step ha been explain with what happen at the background ha been shown use which will boost your you write program on your own the princess of program good do program not they expect to get paid or get by the public but it is fun to program \\t is the new topic insert for those who want to write and program in base my design are work round the clock to content of chapter and are commit to finish remain topic in chapter as as complex is the of program is the most popular program in the world i e program you would learn about comment and header file are good at follow instruct but not at read your mind \\t in the second part i am cover basic of main function in c like return type of main function argument taken by main function and comparison of with do base editor not good at with not good at \\t the part 3 cover a few command code is written use video explain you and of c program use command is it just take a to understand it \\t here is program to convert in to is second part of an interest program listen care is an interest code for you to is of chapter what you have so far \\t a good is base on and not on number \\t is part of life so how could be c is away from of while write program \\t here the of first section is follow by need of control in c with a few real life you learn such control in c you need to know is it and in which you can learn first control in c i e if control and watch care what is the syntax by and how it can be use while write a c program section also cover a one more like in c is second control i e if control in c apart from syntax i am focu on design aspect of program i e import of flowchart with syntax the flow of control ha been explain use and a with real life c program also ha been explain with step by step is not but need to be taken to at the the video give you interest real life for of the nest of if block more life complex know to the happen with c program and logic would help you to convert complex program over all there are 3 logic in c viz logic and logic or and logic not \\t when work on c he want it to be compact such are there in c which hi is one of the best to make the code compact \\t same is explain here with enjoy learn c will be hard to in our life make us perfect program if we want certain part of the code to be then ha the in the form of loop control is to control in c i e loop control in c learn type of loop in c it time to have a look at common part of loop part of loop are to understand the word is from the loop know what i mean don\\'t you syntax is explain with real life and real life follow by program you can and play while write program interest know said that there is no formula for success or even to popular is second type of loop control in c and it is for loop in c though all loop same and the need of a for loop is use while write program in the name is the type of loop in c which is version of the first loop i e while loop use loop while implement data in c \\t are smell \\t listen should not be restrict to childhood \\t so here is wonder follow by of nest of loop in c the speed of life we need to break at the same time we forget the past and move on i mean isn\\'t that the way we live life is syntax and use of 2 statement in c incid keyword wonder explain use \\t special dish is version of basic dish to suit food lover and demand so is the case of loop in c so special loop neither a keyword nor a loop but is a version of while or do while loop in c but use in are make rule for and find to withdraw cash at the get into the car open your laptop or unlock your smart phone you will see menu the world is and option are be it gadget or about that and so made a of one more control in c for menu driven program here is switch case control in c in most interest way is for good enough for oh start with c am like an menu you can look but you can\\'t afford are build block of c it time to learn now to break code into small and small of code task are call as function in c that is the reason c is call as as well as modular which is base on orient program in have a look at to function in c first 4 section we were write code function i e main function we were call a few function like and here we will have a look at type i e of function in c from the day one after take up you have been write int main or void main what doe mean the same is explain here with interest real life enjoy and understand function are import part of c program as a one need not know these concept but understand and use them here is of the same in interest way a c life without pointer is life without food student to learn and power of pointer here is \\t pointer can be made to work if you with them long enough if you with long enough you will mess it program is like a you cannot write a poem without write it yet talk about program as if it were a product process and term of of line of code in so do they book that number on the wrong side of the we should refer number of line of code \\t here is one program to explain how we can write a function to perform 4 task the aim of the program is how to access in other function and make in them life is like program i guess if you love you can put into it \\t here is a recap of all topic we cover so far like data type in c control avail in c function in c and to pointer in last chapter now i my style and cloth from one day to the next but high school i blend in i think a lot of are that way i guess i can write about an array of is to an array video explain you how actual an array work i e how an array element are store in how control can be use to access an array element how an index of an array is use for access an array element etc interact with pointer took place in the last chapter but it just real power of pointer is when you start learn array string and file here is our to pointer video cover which could be perform and which are invalid some of them have got context of array or array rule is import while perform these on pointer these though seem to be to understand are of use when we the string object in c and is more import in than in is so is the against complex \\t pointer play a crucial role in array it is the pointer which help to access element of an array \\t here care how it work in c \\t is an of function chapter and is cover in array chapter find here how an array element and whole array can be sent to the function the key here is the term so my dear student don\\'t forget that you do there must be some kind of bound check be it love passion habit or in world of array in c doe not follow bound check learn here what i mean \\t video explain intern of an array and how it work import to understand the next topic of a few is an array should be spare \\t video explain to concept of array in c play crucial role in access element of array video explain you intern work of two dimens array i that a few i have to to explain you but are for understand program progress by line of code is like aircraft build progress by weight \\t here is quick review of the topic so far much more interest concept will be cover in the next topic i e string in c the last chapter we an array a data type we did not an array of in the last chapter of it peculiar here is is the video to the string i am in the process of for it take time and effort so i will be upload a few content keep do base old as said if your are use latest or there would not be much differ in the code plea cooper till i and them with base or base thank is the way to take the string input from the keyboard and print it on the screen play crucial role in array here is it how is the second part of string input and output i e function avail in c is the import of on string in c function help you to find number of in a string just check it out is the function to two string is the function of string function are the case function avail in the the string can be done by use the function here it is is the function to two string is a code of user function you can compact way of one string to string is the program to convert string to string we are not call function but have written own function can think about algorithm and to write differ code code is one more user function to count number of in a string the user function to two string use pointer or or',\n",

statement do great you do not have to be an expert to take \\t we offer you a free develop store so you can and learn first hand through these click \\t you'll need some of code for your train merchant is an and person web server that run give store design and develop the mean to run and test their work on their window desktop user and develop to the same on a local window as would be avail on a web server under merchant merchant an excel develop for develop to build test and run interact web deploy on a product merchant web server import that we understand how store morph work by know the and proper of the system it will be much easier to complex problem in the you can learn how to custom a merchant store it is that you learn the and the basic of merchant so you have a solid to build upon contain a lot of concept that are import to understand and comprehend dive head first into custom a merchant store the concept and in will give you the background you need to understand how merchant are and the differ element they contain that give merchant design in you will learn to and master the merchant \\t use the admin to about your store learn how to use the power custom option to the perfect store for your \\t one of the most import concept for master the merchant is understand how to and output for the page in we will teach you how to do that for code are two type of you can use in merchant a global and a local in we will talk about differ between the two code are that can be use throughout a merchant page to display a on the screen depend on which item you have assign to a page you have access to differ that you can use to write a to the screen code can contain differ type of data from to text string to when output an to the screen you have differ method to from code in is a collect of data element group under one name a can contain or a in we will dive deep into the and of merchant ha a scope it is either a local which is access use or a global access use the of a local start with l follow by the item be follow by the specif you are access in we'll walk you through these set static content is an part of but what happen when we want to do more what if we want to present specif data to a custom base on a they made or action they took to do we need to be to use statement to let the browser know what content to display code are a few group of that i will walk you through today some of the i will walk you through are logic comparison string and math code we talk about a loop doe is take in data from an array then some code for each item in the array code familiar with while loop in other program similar within merchant in take a look at how merchant while loop code that you have a background on loop with there is one more import concept that will give you a lot more control when work with it is call code familiar with work with array in other program then array in will feel familiar a major differ is that array in are 1 index instead of 0 take a look code go to talk about how to use the function that are part of merchant store code the last video i you with how to work with file system with the we were to check and see if the file exist it if it did and a new file with some data in video go to take it one step further code great part of use assign and in the is you get full access to all the file read write function that are part of merchant access to these function turn merchant into a power program talk more about that in code of these function must be call with two argument here design and is the number of second the begin of c u t at 1 can be obtain from the system and is set when the script start is at the moment that it is which one you use depend on what your program go through the detail \\t for code far work with two local and global in talk about a third call system code go to talk about hint at in a few video is a merchant tool which will show you all the that are on each page walk you through them can be one of the hardest concept in merchant to grasp they are import to how merchant page function an item is a user that specif function to a page all page have item assign to them some of use item would be the bar the tree and the head tag each of these are built in item that are assign to almost all page of the store go though them i want to talk about the differ between local item and global item that are assign to a page in merchant are the to power and in i will talk about how page and item go hand in hand just been to page take a deeper dive into some of the and function of page and how they work are page in merchant that have page with them in the merchant admin an of would be the page it is use to the checkout process it doe not have it own page instead the page ha logic built in that will direct you to either the page inform if you are log in or the page if you are not log in function is all built into the pseudo page go to talk about product list item a product list item is a power part of merchant it control the layout of product list take a look nice new to merchant 9 is the to custom all error on the site in take at look at how to custom the that your custom see field are not just limit to product you can also use them for or custom too learn to custom field can the of your store in walk you through an overview of the custom field option understand custom field and how they work import to understand how custom field have over the year in walk you through from where they began to where they are now code all the problem of exist custom field function in an to the custom field to extend function most critic to the to use custom field from page both read and write in show you how revolut your to custom your store dive into the new custom field syntax there are 8 for read 8 for write and then a debug function to help troubleshoot get start code basket field in merchant are a power develop tool they allow you to save data data you want with the shopper or the basket in walk you through the benefit of tool code merchant custom order field are similar to custom basket field instead of save data from a basket it save data from an order in i will walk you through the process and of power and tool code great about merchant custom field is that import and export through the merchant system in walk you through how to import and export your custom field to a file and even custom it to your need nice about merchant custom field is that they a debug function function can be use time you are have problem read or write a custom field code common thing do as a web develop work with merchant is work with both in the which would be an git or a form post where you have a form that submit to a page and pass input either hidden input or other input within the form the great part about is that it make it see how are a core part of the web and use in almost web site you visit a is just a small of data store local by a browser about a web site in talk about how work within the merchant code \\t one common area of when learn merchant and learn how to develop store in merchant ha to do with merchant default learn more about we now know that all pass in the global if you take a look at default that a of that are usual there dive into a few of them see them over and over again are what tell merchant what to do we touch on action in the last an action is an or a hidden input in learn more about action i want to dive in to merchant file specif the of the file and folder on the server get start page use the base tag which is a standard tag use to reset the base when use rel path for and more in learn more about page and how they to your store code a develop one thing that need to do quit a bit is stage your they go live you a code say to add new code and content when you hit the are reflect on the web site happen in real time so in a case where you want to make a lot of and preview it it live need to stage it in show you how code nice of merchant is the to turn on mode mode is a set the merchant admin mean no one can do with your store while in mode do major to the site say redo the look and feel of it is a perfect of

merchant explain how to a there are a to process which go to go over are a develop tool that allow you to take a snapshot of the look and feel and save it into a file or that can be move and from one store to the next walk you through process in go to walk through how to a framework to do we are go to use the free bootstrap develop framework is a free framework can download and use for your store thing you may want to do as a develop is to your own frame work base off of all the common thing you need to do when build a merchant store merchant make a framework and walk you through the process in go to talk about how to take a design slice it up and put that design into merchant is a part video will talk about the home page and how to global element such as a global header and footer and

that i have been aim for for year we get into the meat of the though i think it make sen to cover some key do i mean by in the strictest sen we can a person as whose their basic live for and their i want to take the concept further the is who of ha money but is richer still are not constrain in how they spend their time where they to work and what they to way we can with the concept of to process that would have of open free or low cost the can barrier to enter their chosen market that would have prevent similar bud entrepreneur of to do the same don't need to go back too year to see how the rule have you want to start an pr year ago you would to base yourself in a furnish with the usual the would need to be near to client and a talent pool of or contractor client would either or an and market budget either way they would need contact or cash and prefer both isn't the case in mean the same entrepreneur can work from home hire all over the world and social media and smart market to

the is work less and earn more they have the to their on project that will sustain are by skill profess though rare do they use these skill to benefit the reason for is that most of their time is spent swap for money on the other hand can afford to split their time part and help client and part and help spend time and on that the with stream of grow over time they for more and more freedom from grasp for the next job consist to get the contract or put up with second class from client so as not to lose them can which job to take and which to they need no particular job and no particular client person power and profess respect stem from do they go from here in my there are two option to maintain what can by all account be class as great which work to do and be paid for it or make the move toward a larger latter of is the rout to greater wealth though of the freedom discuss will obviou be point of is to put in your hand you how to move from a who scrape by to one who is at in the is it that most don't wealth main reason is time there is of is there is so much of it have a to set their up in a way that swap their time for money do they almost by cap their maximum if your work day is hour and you an hour you are of limit to a day you have the workload and your rate is high you will make a good but you will never be hour you don't work is hour you are not paid for second problem block from wealth is a to market their is the case for who loath the idea of salesmanship there are of who just do great work and over time they are reward with great client but take time and is of a type of market in third reason is the to task and their in a way that lend itself to scale and growth wealth can come for the who can earn money at a of their effort and at a rate that is not sole depend on direct action work for it is use staff to have a per hour price model and grow a success law firm do all the time the key is that it is other time is trade for the money not just your tend to neglect their system they start to take on more client but have no custom relationship tool to and foster these account lead to not miss sale but as project and task are and rush out the door with in mind look at how is go to help you a wealth first object is to make you look at your differ you may see yourself as a design artist technician or coder but what you are is a small owner plain

hello world you will learn to your first with watch kit on learn to work with label and group make a share some tip to help your code if you have question plea upload your code see what will we got at the end of we have to make a design first you make app first of all you will come from your idea after that you should draw out your idea draw out how your app look like how and how button how that we will have a over view about our app and we can make an app you can that when we make a app like we are build a we build a we have to make a design for our and you know you can the time of make app from 2 or 3 time if you do so let start make our design first of all we will make an part for our and start with make a new project and make for part \\t as you can see we have a bug when we run our on a differ screen size doe not show up as we design so in i will help you use the auto layout to fix bug use auto layout you can see we have a bug when we run our on a differ screen size doe not show up as we design so in i will help you use the auto layout to fix bug use auto layout time for us to connect all the element on the to our for control it of all we have to which element on the we will we have to connect that element to our code for control \\t a start function for start count time for our stopwatch - to make a watch in our app use a timer to the time \\t timer = self nil when we have a of timer we need a function to format the to the format which we string { a = = = date = we will make a stop function for our watch when user press stop we want to stop the timer and reset the fix the bug when we press stop button we start the timer fix bug when we press the play button again when our stopwatch is run we will make a function for our watch when user press we want to stop the timer save the when user press play we will a new timer and shift the timer to the when user press play similar like a play button we will fix the bug when user press the button two time or user press the button we press play \\t - set up a when the user press the lap we will got the lap and show up to the our lap \\t - setup a clear function for user clear the set up a when the user press the lap we will got the lap and show up to the our lap setup a clear function for user clear the you can see function of our app is good now but we need to decor our for better user could you do that add a to app one time but we will do it again that you don't how to do that \\t - we will add a target to our \\t - similar like part we will make a for our watch app like our design \\t - to work with group on in we don't have auto layout function so we have to all the element by group and side with on the doe not support add a video or to our watch yet so we have to use a of to a to our app do that similar like we did on part time for us to hook all the element to out code for control when we add a new to our app the will help us a with swift for control the element in the doe not support the so we have to the by sever now we will make a connect between and app use function \\t - in the use to send a request to = and after that we will the from { : ) void in \\t if error nil { \\t \\t } \\t in use a will the request depend on the \\t : : ) ) { \\t if let = as { \\t if let = { \\t if { \\t \\t } \\t } \\t } \\t } will finish to send the request for all of our button on the we will send a differ request info depend on which button is press can send a request to part and a from part but that is from we want to the data and want to send back data to for we want to send the lap or the lap to our how can we do that we will make a swift file to save the info and and we will use a to send the info to app for run a function for us you can think it like now we will a new swift file that can save the the request and the to our watch { \\t let = \\t var : ) void \\t var \\t : : ) { \\t if let = as : { \\t = \\t } { \\t no \\t } \\t = \\t } that we will a object and use a to send it to our = \\t now we can on on add a stopwatch and fix when user press twice time when run stopwatch similar like part we will add new to check the stopwatch is run or not use a : to your function use a delay function to delay code and make a we will have a bug of function will run after we press more than two time in button to ask a question and fix our bug make a function for lap clear and get the lap button by send a request to part is a for you to my a develop of and is my third on is help you to make your own for watch as you know ha about watch from last year and they said that watch will be sale in at of the beta with watch kit for develop all around the world to make their and for of watch first of all if you don't know what watch is and how is is i think is the web site you should take a look you will use beta for code basic about code your time\",\n",
